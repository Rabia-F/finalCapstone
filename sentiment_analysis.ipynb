      "I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.\n",
      "This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!\n",
      "Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark\n",
      "I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.\n",
      "Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.\n",
      "This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.\n",
      "I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.\n",
      "I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge\n",
      "amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model\n",
      "It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though.\n",
      "If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.\n",
      "Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book.\n",
      "Good product for child. Who only need to read the books\n",
      "This Kindle is a convenient size yet lettering is easy to read.\n",
      "I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers.\n",
      "It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright\n",
      "Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it!\n",
      "Item work well and was easy to read from in day light\n",
      "Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good\n",
      "Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!\n",
      "I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.\n",
      "This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.\n",
      "Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device\n",
      "The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.\n",
      "I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome\n",
      "Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.\n",
      "My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.\n",
      "I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.\n",
      "I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.\n",
      "I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.\n",
      "My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader.\n",
      "I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased\n",
      "Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts\n",
      "Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun.\n",
      "I lie the size and weight for the kindle-makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format.\n",
      "Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend\n",
      "Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere.\n",
      "I never used kindle before. My wife gifted me on my birthday. This is the amazing product. I am using it for daily reading. The display is fantastic and no strain on eyes.\n",
      "I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!\n",
      "The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again\n",
      "I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!\n",
      "Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use.\n",
      "The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight.\n",
      "I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare.\n",
      "I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.\n",
      "Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use.\n",
      "Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it.\n",
      "working well and very cheap if we think in the price way\n",
      "The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model.\n",
      "This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.\n",
      "The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading\n",
      "After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it's going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight\n",
      "I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.\n",
      "Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!\n",
      "I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.\n",
      "the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.\n",
      "This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you.\n",
      "I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.\n",
      "i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.\n",
      "We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. \"Why would U want to read in the dark?\" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.\n",
      "Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too\n",
      "Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient\n",
      "I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month\n",
      "it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.\n",
      "Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.\n",
      "Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.\n",
      "Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.\n",
      "Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.\n",
      "Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.\n",
      "My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.\n",
      "For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.\n",
      "It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.\n",
      "Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.\n",
      "When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.\n",
      "My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003.\n",
      "It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it.\n",
      "This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.\n",
      "I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.\n",
      "it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.\n",
      "This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.\n",
      "As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work\n",
      "I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger.\n",
      "Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where\n",
      "This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two.\n",
      "My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.\n",
      "Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.\n",
      "I love my Kindle! I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone.\n",
      "I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.\n",
      "It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.\n",
      "The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness\n",
      "I should have purchased a kindle sooner. It's easy to use and I love it!\n",
      "This was purchased as a gift and they've absolutely loved it.\n",
      "Great Gift for anyone. Very easy to setup. Coexist with all IOT Devices. Alexa is AWESOME!\n",
      "Super excited to give this as a gift. It's super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon.\n",
      "We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me.\n",
      "Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome!\n",
      "Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff\n",
      "Great looking design. Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use.\n",
      "The product is very entertaining and useful. Would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life.\n",
      "This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs\n",
      "I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box!\n",
      "Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo.\n",
      "I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol\n",
      "I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that's nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny.\n",
      "Great product, very much recommended. Service at Best buy is always the best\n",
      "I bought 2 of these for gifts. I love my Echo and think the new one will be incredible too! After the holidays, I will buy one for myself!\n",
      "I can watch videos, check my security cameras, and grey two for a fantastic price\n",
      "Dreams need topics, song lyrics scroll during song play, watch movies/trailers and etc. With it, if you can get it on sale, bought my for special deal at Best Buy for $129.99. not sure if the value is there at the regular price of$249.99. but it is very cool device.\n",
      "information on weather, updates on music, events. Fun questions answered while working in kitchen. Good sound for a limited areaGreat sales assistance at Best Buy\n",
      "bought for christmas present for son and family so we can communicate visually.\n",
      "The Amazon echo is excellent. Easy to set up, and we now use it to automate the entire house from our air-conditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs. We went and got one for everyone in our family.\n",
      "I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature.\n",
      "I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great. The microphone picks up my voice very easily, the sound quality is great, and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table!\n",
      "this echo show lets you see so much, great item for your home!\n",
      "The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology. This product removes those barriers.\n",
      "I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon.\n",
      "Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future.\n",
      "Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.\n",
      "It's at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus\n",
      "Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen.\n",
      "I have 2 of these in my house work great I just bought 4 for Christmas gifts for my family\n",
      "We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!\n",
      "The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.\n",
      "It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!\n",
      "I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise.\n",
      "I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time.\n",
      "We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!\n",
      "We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews\n",
      "Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen\n",
      "I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased (two were presents for family at Christmas). This one was for me. I love being able to hear music, connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions. Best purchase I could have made!\n",
      "Awesome sound which was unexpected. It's nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc.\n",
      "I love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands.\n",
      "Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it\n",
      "We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...\n",
      "By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home.\n",
      "Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!\n",
      "I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product\n",
      "I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....\n",
      "My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.\n",
      "Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!\n",
      "Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price.\n",
      "We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning.\n",
      "My girlfriend loves the echo show, I bought two of them...\n",
      "Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional.\n",
      "It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun!\n",
      "I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great.\n",
      "Like having another person in the house, I talk to Alexa more then my wife\n",
      "I really love it I use it everyday and it works great\n",
      "We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit!\n",
      "The Echo Show is a game changer, it's amazing as are all the Echo's but with this one you can watch video's, or see who's at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it's like having a personal assistant.\n",
      "Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests.\n",
      "Great product fun to use. Very easy to set up and begin useing\n",
      "Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift.\n",
      "Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product.\n",
      "Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.\n",
      "I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom.\n",
      "Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.\n",
      "I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!\n",
      "I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it.\n",
      "Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom.\n",
      "Fantastic product and does exactly as described. Great gift idea!\n",
      "We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them!\n",
      "I bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it!\n",
      "We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to \"call papa\" or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights!\n",
      "I find myself saying to my phone, \"Alexa, play.........\". I wish they made it for my car too.\n",
      "Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed!\n",
      "Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible\n",
      "I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.\n",
      "Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.\n",
      "I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it.\n",
      "we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids.\n",
      "I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE\n",
      "I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music.\n",
      "What a treat! What‚Äôs the weather forecast? What‚Äôs the news this morning?? Just about all you need to know - plus Smart home control!!\n",
      "I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles. Can't wait for them to open their gifts\n",
      "The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home. Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice. Great display and available information is awesome.\n",
      "Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi.\n",
      "I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa\n",
      "I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better\n",
      "Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone.\n",
      "When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the \"Front Porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!\n",
      "This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct\n",
      "I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me\n",
      "Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up ..\n",
      "This product is great and a nice addition to the echo family.\n",
      "Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease. Works great\n",
      "We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that's not always the case. It's not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it!\n",
      "Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa\n",
      "At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc.\n",
      "I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It's the perfect kitchen assistant.\n",
      "This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature\n",
      "I love everything about this Alexa... if you‚Äôre on the fence.. just buy it.. it does everything!!!\n",
      "If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you\n",
      "For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside \"smart\" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!\n",
      "She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great\n",
      "The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up\n",
      "This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.\n",
      "This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.\n",
      "It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent\n",
      "I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product!\n",
      "I have been transforming my house to a smart home. So far thus is my favorite. Does so much I learn more each day\n",
      "The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual.\n",
      "I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers.\n",
      "I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.\n",
      "I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.\n",
      "no problems so far I'm enjoying it. suggestion : it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers / sound system\n",
      "We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well.\n",
      "This is not my first Echo product - we have 3 Echo dots. This is a step up for us. I have it placed in the kitchen and love it! The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature. I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself.\n",
      "Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family\n",
      "almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy, Once in a while it doesn't hear you right but that's probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems\n",
      "This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.\n",
      "I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!!\n",
      "We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing.\n",
      "This is awesome and the sound is amazing, the screen is outstanding\n",
      "Very neat item, fun to talk to. Easy set up to use.\n",
      "You can play trivia with your family and learn a lot about the world\n",
      "Love it , it‚Äôs my second Alexa it‚Äôs conceted to everything in my house thinking about buying more\n",
      "The ease of use and comparability with Smart Home products make a this an awesome product .\n",
      "I‚Äôve had Amazon Alexa since she first hit the streets over two years ago and Echo Show is awesome! It can do so much more than Alexa and Echo Dot! You will love it!\n",
      "This is the favorite of the house, even our visitors love it, is amazing!\n",
      "Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?\n",
      "Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information\n",
      "I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!\n",
      "It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.\n",
      "Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good.\n",
      "THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED.\n",
      "It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!\n",
      "I seen one that my son-in-law had and enjoyed using it.\n",
      "I love how I can see my grandkids. I also bought my kids one so they can just \"Drop In\" and I can see them. It also shows words to some songs to sing along. It is fun to have!!\n",
      "The best product I have used for AI. Easy set up and easy to use.\n",
      "If you‚Äôre lik me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door\n",
      "he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras.\n",
      "Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated\n",
      "It has been wonderful. I bought it for my boyfriend but I get more use out of it then he does\n",
      "The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.\n",
      "The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.\n",
      "This is the best assistant from Amazon, with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices!Simply awesome!\n",
      "I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon......\n",
      "The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone\n",
      "Works great! Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better! They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing\n",
      "i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great!\n",
      "If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.\n",
      "Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!\n",
      "9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above.\n",
      "Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing!\n",
      "Used in my home office, gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores. Plays any music that I request, decent quality sound.\n",
      "I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine\n",
      "Great sound and amazing options. Love this!!! Great replacement for original echo\n",
      "I bought this as a gift so I haven't gotten to use it much yet. The initial setup was really easy and I am sure that she is going to love it!\n",
      "Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices.\n",
      "Having 3 amazon echos I had to pick up these to add to more rooms. These work best in the bedroom or kitchen. Video display is bright. Video calling is a great addition and is flawlessly, get them when they go on sale\n",
      "I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better. Who doesn‚Äôt like seeing the lyrics of the music, or using video chat with other echo shows. I have two and thinking of getting another one soon.\n",
      "User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool\n",
      "I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She loved them!\n",
      "I love it.. easy to use. Many different features...\n",
      "The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I've ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home!\n",
      "it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too\n",
      "Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear.\n",
      "Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.\n",
      "I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour.\n",
      "Amazon's Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast\n",
      "my children loving alexa always talking to alexa every day hehehe\n",
      "Alexa is a great product that can perform tasks and answer all kinds of questions. The Show and its video feature makes it that much more interactive.\n",
      "I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home\n",
      "Alexa controls my lights, TV and sound system. Very happy with this.\n",
      "We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot\n",
      "Love the Amazon Echo Show! The video display is so helpful. Very good quality video and audio sounds better than the Echo Plus speaker. Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books. Need to know a measurement conversion? Just ask Alexa! Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options.\n",
      "Love my new I Pad, and New TV for my kitchenAlso bought 3 Alexa with pods for my family at xmas\n",
      "Just an average Alexa option. Does show a few things on screen but still limited.\n",
      "I got this as a spur of the moment thing. I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it's actually a very helpful device for organizing, shopping, smart home control, listening to music, or even watching some videos while I'm washing dishes. My show is in my kitchen and I've used it for countless things. I think this is amazon's best Alexa yet.\n",
      "Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more!\n",
      "I love the ECHO- Alexa is awesome... it was a Christmas present... Also received two Dots to place in other rooms....\n",
      "Bought this to start implementing smart home features. Gets the job done and the screen is a nice addition.\n",
      "If you keep asking it to do things, you will be surprised at how much it can do\n",
      "Bought this for a Christmas gift, so haven't actually seen this in action yet. Checked other reviews and they were good, and Best Buy had an awesome Black Friday price.\n",
      "The show is an all in one Alexa-enabled machine. I love the words to the songs and I'm all about being able to watch my amazon prime videos.\n",
      "Fun and easy to use. Music sounds great. Set timers, reminders and sync your calendar. I'm giving one as a gift to my daughter so we can video chat with \"drop in\" any time.\n",
      "Plug n play, easy to use. Speakers are good for music.\n",
      "I love this thing! It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack\n",
      "The Echo Show is a great addition to the Amazon family. Works just like the Echo, but with a 7\" screen. Bright vibrant display. Rich clear sound. Works great with Arlo security cameras. Excellent smart home addition. Just hope Google and Amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again.\n",
      "purchased for a capstone team to test and review how it would benefit today's journalist.\n",
      "This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!\n",
      "Fairly easy to use on set up and use. Most annoying issue is when the kids try to talk to her. Mainly use for music and general information.\n",
      "I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next.\n",
      "Amazon ECHO show is excellent with add-on video features. The screen is smaller than I expected but meet the requirements.\n",
      "4 stars only because its s e is bing. works great with arlo cameras\n",
      "Display is great for doing video calls with others with echo show. Works well with home automation devices. Sound is great for listening to music.\n",
      "I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself.\n",
      "My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it.\n",
      "Great addition to the amazon device family. Great Christmas gift.\n",
      "We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy\n",
      "I wasn't sure what to expect from my echo show, but I am super happy that I bought it. Alexa is great. She tells me the weather, traffic, news updates and more each day.\n",
      "Great for looking up recipes when your cooking and your hands are tied up. Also, perfect for ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù on family & friends.\n",
      "I already have 6 Amazon devices (2 Echo's and 4 Dot's). I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also.\n",
      "Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.\n",
      "Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is \"show\", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do \"drop in\", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.\n",
      "Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go.\n",
      "The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.\n",
      "Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!\n",
      "I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :)\n",
      "No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus.\n",
      "We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen.\n",
      "I love the echo show. It is a personal assistant, DJ, weatherman & news person all in one. This is our second Show. We love the video qualties & the sound can't be beat.\n",
      "My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store\n",
      "Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint, it's the next step in Amazon's capabilities, adding visual to the sound that was already there.\n",
      "I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account. It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it.\n",
      "The echo show works great for home automation. Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features.\n",
      "Its great, just needs expanding information on it.\n",
      "We had the Echo (still do, it's just in another room) and purchased the Show. We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other. As you walk by the Show, it gives mini tips, news, fun facts, etc. Love it! You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show.\n",
      "My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift. Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year, I think the Show is much better. The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing. Both my wife and daughter love it.\n",
      "This thing is awesome, great speakers on it too. Go out and grab one\n",
      "Our 5th Echo Show. We love the Drop In feature, allowing us to use them as an intercom. The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house, and controlled from any device is used daily. The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus. Also connected to our Dish TV receiver.\n",
      "I love the Echo Show and its many features, great purchase.\n",
      "I use to communicate with family. I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone. It has more to offer, but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch.\n",
      "Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more!\n",
      "Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report\n",
      "Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa.\n",
      "I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts.\n",
      "The screen really does add tremendous value. The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago.\n",
      "We really enjoy the Echo Show! I have the Echo in the living room & the Echo Show in the bedroom. It‚Äôs great to have the visual of all the requests for Alexa\n",
      "Love it, bought one for everyone in the family.. I know they‚Äôll love it too\n",
      "Purchased for my 87 year old mother as a safety/convenience, entertainment device. She loves it! finds it easy to use, loves to have music throughout the house.\n",
      "Amazon has made another great product! The ‚Äúshow‚Äù goes perfectly in the kitchen! Recipes, music,weather! All done hands free!! Fast set up!\n",
      "I bought these as a gift for my adult kids to video chat while in college. The second best feature was YouTube. Amazon just sell google home and chromcast for goodness sakes!\n",
      "Another great echo product... really cool feature is the lyrics scrolling across the screen when playing music!\n",
      "It works fast and very clear, speakers sound amazing, looks great in bedroom.\n",
      "I have several versions of Amazon's Echos - the original, and Echo Plus, 2 Taps and 2 Dots. The Show is the best sounding of the bunch and you have the screen as a bonus. I added a battery pack to make it portable and it's perfect for us.\n",
      "Fun and useful, very interactive and still learning all abilities.\n",
      "It‚Äôs great I use it a lot and yes I will tell friends and family about it\n",
      "I really like it it‚Äôs user-friendly and I was by 55 Coolidge from Apple family to the family\n",
      "It has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen. I think we use it much more than we thought we would.\n",
      "Alexa reminds me of all my appointments and it‚Äôs a great tool\n",
      "Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device.\n",
      "Easy to log in and set up. Good sound. Needs a remote for the volume as is changes with each radio station, song, or replies.\n",
      "alexa is awesome and screen makes her even better can't wait to get another\n",
      "Thanks for the display version of Alexa - I love this model.\n",
      "This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things.\n",
      "Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.\n",
      "I have a lot of Echos devices. Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen. The screen is bright and sharp, and it's a nice feature to follow recipes, watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screen.It's also the best way to see calendar entries, to do and shopping lists.\n",
      "I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies.\n",
      "I am just learning what the Amazon Echo Show will do. I've used it as a timer, I've listened to Iheart radio, I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time. Alexa turns them on/off when I tell her to. When the holiday rush is over, I will go online to learn many more things.\n",
      "This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs\n",
      "I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it\n",
      "One of my favorite gadgets. It can do so .any things.\n",
      "Easy set up, simple to use, and lots of fun! Alexa can tell you the weather forecast, play any music you‚Äôd like to hear, read you recipes and so much more! Great product\n",
      "Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly.\n",
      "Best item I ever use. I would love to get another one.\n",
      "Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps. She gives funny answers to funny question. However, she is not a complete internet surfer, many things she has no answer.\n",
      "I bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for Christmas. Not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids, which the one year old loves!\n",
      "Using it in my kitchen. The whole family has access and we can all use different functionality. Great for looking up recipies, music and calling relatives or friends\n",
      "I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera, and it works well. I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request. I guess I will have to buy the plug for it. This was very easy to set up. Downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup.\n",
      "I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn't the screen provides nothing of value and you can't turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can't even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster!\n",
      "Im impressed with it. I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio\n",
      "Very easy to use and good quality, nice picture and good size for a desk\n",
      "This Alexa device is great fun, and useful for several personal assistant type applications. I use it in conjunction with some TP-Link Light switches, and it works flawlessly. It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays, and calling other people who have the show or spot works well. She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms. Another useful feature is as an in home intercom.\n",
      "I Love this I don't even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her.\n",
      "Great help from assistants in the store. They were very knowledgeable and took the time to help me choose the right product for my needs.\n",
      "It's nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too.\n",
      "Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot. I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance.\n",
      "Easy setup for connections to wi-fi cameras, Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soon....YouTube. Add your videos and BOOM...to the screen they come.\n",
      "Good for Amazon music and news. Brilliant for controlling lights in the house.\n",
      "I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.\n",
      "This is an awesome device, but it isn't life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don't use the video much.\n",
      "Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to music,asking questions and controlling devices .the sound front the speakers is really great.\n",
      "Love this product easy to use and it does so much ch\n",
      "purchased the show after I picked up the ECHO PLUS, 2 DOT'S & a TAP! This smart home system is addictive and I will be adding more soon!\n",
      "Does what it is advertise for and more. Had fun setting it up and amazed on what it can do. I even use it for security.\n",
      "Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday.\n",
      "Its an awesome item. Me and the kids love it.\n",
      "Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.\n",
      "Recently divorced I bought 2 of these tonserve as homebase for me and my 8 year old. It has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy\n",
      "My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.\n",
      "We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.\n",
      "I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.\n",
      "Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her. Works awesome.\n",
      "Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money!\n",
      "Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.\n",
      "Amazing. I seriously didn't know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now.\n",
      "The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos, the security cameras connected to your house, listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show.\n",
      "Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, \"Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous.\"\n",
      "I purchased this for my husbandHe had been waiting for it for a long timeHe owns Alexa and loved iti do too\n",
      "The Echo Show device connects with a range of services, including Amazon Music to expand your experience. Ask questions and see the answers with the Echo Show, which connects to Alexa for an immersive search experience.\n",
      "Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy\n",
      "I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up. You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private. I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use.\n",
      "The echo show does so much,the music line up is good,it can do anything.\n",
      "Excellent addition to our Amazon components. It is especially better than other versions at hearing varying voices and responding to commands.\n",
      "A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products. The visuals are amazing, and it is so easy to use and set up.\n",
      "Lot to learn, but great device. Connecting to other devices can be frustrating, but over time should be better. Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker, then tried the dot. Seems connection can be to only one device at a time. Still checking help app but limited info.\n",
      "I love it, it works great, I love the drop in func.\n",
      "I love having this in my kitchen, it has replaced my ipad that i used to use.\n",
      "I love to use Alexa to listen to music, set timer,alarms,and ect. My parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system.\n",
      "Was debating on the purchase but looked very cool ,good quality video chat is clear\n",
      "I got two of these, super easy to set up. Only used them one day so far.Can't fine one thing I don't like about them.\n",
      "I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product!\n",
      "Love the Alexa A.I. Better than apple and google versions. The screen gives even more points because you can see all of Alexa‚Äôs responses as well as video call. Awesome\n",
      "Works great with my Ring doorbell and Ring security cameras. Love that I can see live feeds on my Echo show\n",
      "$150 is a good price for this Alexa with a screen.\n",
      "Great accessory for Alexis system..helpful and fun\n",
      "The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!!\n",
      "Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion).\n",
      "Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item.\n",
      "It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn't do Netflix, or Hulu, but that's okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It's easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid's goodnight, when I am working late.\n",
      "This really is a great product, it has performed as expected so far\n",
      "A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products. The visuals are amazing, and it is so easy to use and set up.\n",
      "I love my amazon show it‚Äôs a recommended product if you wanna have this item. However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it‚Äôs full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you. Another downside google hates amazon = not YouTube.\n",
      "I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home.\n",
      "Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I'm a new customer there\n",
      "Such a cool product. We primarily use it for music‚Äî definitely rivals brand name speakers, but can be used for so much more\n",
      "This is great. The entire family is using it. Son‚Äôs are using it for it music, husband for appointments, me for just about everything. It‚Äôs useful and fun.\n",
      "Great product will recommend it to friends and family.\n",
      "What a neat gadget. I thought I loved my echo dot n this is so much more. I like that u can video chat with other people who own it also. The kids love it\n",
      "Bought this for my better half and she loves it. It works very well with echo and has unlimited features.\n",
      "I was hesitant on purchasing this new echo but I'm glad I did. I really like having the feedback on the screen and seeing results in addition to the voice. Using it for weather, recipes and anything that can be displayed is a big help. The echo show responds fairly fast and looks great in my kitchen counter. A definite winner on this one.\n",
      "It did exactly what it's suppose to and I'm still learning new features a month after having it! Very good decice\n",
      "If you use the Alexa ecosystem then the show is a must.\n",
      "This is my third echo, and the video screen is a nice addition. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option. The only thing that's is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well. Also, at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet. (e.g. watch cable tv over internet).\n",
      "As good as echo, with added visuals can be usefulAnd fun\n",
      "I use it for everything.... Mainly as my new alarm clock. cant wait for them to open it up even more.\n",
      "Recently upgraded from Alexa 1st generation. Really like the video screen and how much more it can do\n",
      "I love it I can call and do video camaras hear music\n",
      "My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell.\n",
      "We put in the kitchen for the holidays and used a lot of new recipes Alexa found for us\n",
      "I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done\n",
      "Got for my parents as a gift. Simple to use and they like it. Got on sale so was good value.\n",
      "I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere. I use it for a lot of things.\n",
      "Bought my 5 daughters each one for Christmas & one for myself .. love the concept\n",
      "Great video quality, sound/music from a rather small device. Seems well made, entertaining, and more functional as we learn its many features.\n",
      "Bought for my parents, they love it. Easy to use and setup\n",
      "Haven‚Äôt set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better!\n",
      "Echo show has proven to be a handy gadget... useful for lots of things, like checking weather and just about any info on the web...also has great interfacing with other smart tech, like arlo cameras, ring doorbells, fire tv, etc. the more I use it the more I find it is useful, and the more I like it\n",
      "not a real fan of AI, but Alexa has become quite handy, entertaining, and informative. The Show itself, allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them, in 1 simple step.Shows family photos stored in Amazon account.One word, simply AMAZING!!!Bought 1 for my parents, and they USE it!!!\n",
      "I bought this as a gift. They love it! It is really helpful to have around the house. Great product.\n",
      "with alexa in control you may need extra time to jog\n",
      "Added screen a great features visual effect a plus\n",
      "Love it. Simple setup. Ease of use. Very intuitive and fun.\n",
      "Awesome product. DoEs what it says and looks great\n",
      "Purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family. Luv the display.\n",
      "This product is great. I wish there was a way to play music from my phone other than Bluetooth only.\n",
      "She is not a technical person but enjoys the screen feature and uses it for cooking recipes.\n",
      "It's not open yet it's a bday gift. But I think they will love it\n",
      "Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.\n",
      "Love it. Does everything I want it to do and more.\n",
      "i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts\n",
      "Long time Alexa user. The video screen just takes it to the next level great product\n",
      "I loved the Amazon Echo, but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing! I highly recommend.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.\n",
      "Great and easy to set up. We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it. Alexa is learning what our family likes each day. My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well.\n",
      "I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.\n",
      "This product worked very well and very easy to use.\n",
      "This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy\n",
      "The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.\n",
      "Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ...\n",
      "I use this thing every night to fall asleep. Although Alexa don‚Äôt always understand me I still love the device.\n",
      "Finally decided to try Alexa. Lights, heating, doors, etc... everything is homekit compatible in my house. But this one was too tempting! What a great device. Alexa is years ahead of Siri, great system to have by your bed, and it also controls most of my devices...\n",
      "Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.\n",
      "The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized.\n",
      "she loves it, got it for her for xmas, we all love to play with it.\n",
      "Love the new video version ! Easy to setup and great to use!\n",
      "Echo show is a great product.Good with my security cameras and playing music.Youtube would be great.\n",
      "If you use an Echo, you will love the Echo Show. Bought this one for a relative after they experienced mine.\n",
      "Great product and it is very easy to set up and use\n",
      "Echo show easy to set up. Wish it included the swivel base that is a option now. Love the added video!\n",
      "Plays any music you request, answers questions, even tells jokes to my 10 yr old. Much more capability than we've unleashed yet!\n",
      "Alexa with screen? LOVE it! Works perfectly with my Ring doorbell.\n",
      "We got this since we have the previous echo and love them. Easy to use and set up. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter !\n",
      "This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you'll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead.\n",
      "I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff\n",
      "Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly\n",
      "This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.\n",
      "Bought this for my mom. She thinks it's great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items.\n",
      "The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices.\n",
      "This amazon echo is most likely the best way to go!\n",
      "A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful\n",
      "Got this for my mother who's eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments. She can now video chat with members of the family. Send emails, check her appointments, place phone calls just by requesting it. It has helped her so much.\n",
      "Nice device. Good to enable drop in conversations. Some flash briefings. But overall still a little limited in effective use of video\n",
      "My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!!\n",
      "It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube\n",
      "Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!\n",
      "I love the echo show! The only thing I dislike is it doesn't play YouTube videos. Not a deal breaker though.\n",
      "a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!\n",
      "Bought the Echo Show to add on all my smart wifi appliances, wifi video doorbell, smart TV & sound bar, wifi smart lights, wifi smart thermostat, wifi security camera system and so on.\n",
      "Great overall, would be nice to have parental controls though.\n",
      "The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!\n",
      "I bought 2 shows and I am loving them. Them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized. I don't have to keep my phone on me 24/7 to keep in touch with my closest family members; they can just drop in and I can do the same with the kids when away from the house. I made 2 more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room. I love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly. They are a must have for a modern home.\n",
      "Enjoying Alexa! There is so much you can ask her! Looking forward to the security monitoring .\n",
      "I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.\n",
      "Product works well and is fairly simple to operate\n",
      "The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other.\n",
      "Like the fact that I can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system.\n",
      "I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion.\n",
      "Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.\n",
      "qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly.\n",
      "I didn't expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise\n",
      "THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK & C PEEPS!!!\n",
      "It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn‚Äôt play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services\n",
      "Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you\n",
      "We love our echo show, It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things.\n",
      "When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it.\n",
      "Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon!\n",
      "Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do.\n",
      "Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it.\n",
      "It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites\n",
      "Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me \"Alexa find videos on f450 drone\" Alexa \"YouTube is not available\". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.\n",
      "It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.\n",
      "Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.\n",
      "Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work!\n",
      "If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy\n",
      "Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased.\n",
      "Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone\n",
      "Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!!\n",
      "I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock\n",
      "This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful.\n",
      "We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it\n",
      "I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful. Would recommend this product and definitely this model. :)\n",
      "We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year, and love it so much! Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did (ages 11 and 13)! Highly Recommend!\n",
      "We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad. We set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use. He loves it. Excellent product. No end to the features you can set up.\n",
      "This device is alot better than the small alexa. Did everything i wanted it to\n",
      "Great amazon device i love these have 2 in my house they are awesome\n",
      "A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well.\n",
      "Was so excited to get this!!! It is so much fun to use.\n",
      "Great product but the only downside is that it did NOT work with my home security camera\n",
      "Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do\n",
      "The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,\"Google is not supported on Echo Show.\" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.\n",
      "Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home!\n",
      "Talk to it and see responses on the touch screen. Love it!!\n",
      "This is a great addition to the Echo family, bringing new and cool features.\n",
      "Great device for music and face time calls. The sound is crisp and clear. Many options with the Echo Show\n",
      "Easy to set up. But it does not work with all phones.. I have Samsung 4\n",
      "Easy to set up and use. Useful and fun. The videos make things easy to understand.\n",
      "We bought 2 of them and love them. The screen is really clear and the sound is amazing. Go get one\n",
      "I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that.\n",
      "if nothing else I have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then I can now better assist\n",
      "My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time. She is fun to have around.\n",
      "Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.\n",
      "love it and it only keeps getting better over time.\n",
      "Great product, i recommend is easy to use and fast.\n",
      "Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device.\n",
      "The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things. When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show, I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account. The Show was in my kitchen, easy to view, and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room. I love it!\n",
      "Everybody enjoys this product. We use it to show each other things from my home to my daughters in Melbourne, Florida, keep a running shopping list that can be seen just by asking, and for both verbal and visual reminders of events.\n",
      "I was unsure if this was worth it before I did. After buying and bringing it home I‚Äôm glad I did. I enjoy being able to video chat threw it!\n",
      "Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much\n",
      "Bought for my 88 year old Mom, she loves it, help her with recipes and cooking.\n",
      "Enjoy being able to view my Ring doorbell camera in live time upstairs\n",
      "This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display.\n",
      "The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.\n",
      "I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen.\n",
      "This is the main reason why I went with Amazon's Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion.\n",
      "I'm disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn't understand\n",
      "Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from\n",
      "I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the $200+ price point, but I tried it and love it! If I could afford it, and if they would add an audio port, I would replace my current Alexas with Echo Shows.\n",
      "The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device. It's great being able to \"see\" what is going on!!\n",
      "The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .\n",
      "Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such.\n",
      "This thing is cool, you can do a lot of neat things with the show, hope they add more functionality to Alexa though.\n",
      "We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions\n",
      "This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There's a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It's fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement.\n",
      "We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!!\n",
      "Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state!\n",
      "I love all my Alexa's I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family.\n",
      "I have a couple of these echos, they are wonderful they do everything like turn my lights on or the TV, my granddaughter love asking it question\n",
      "Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.\n",
      "We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!\n",
      "I really enjoy having another way to communicate with family and friends\n",
      "Awesome all around product - great picture and like the voice control.\n",
      "I knew this item would be great, but the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "Alexa has changed my life. I now own 3 Alexas. O\n",
      "Great product with cool features! Easy to install! I love the way it looks and feels.\n",
      "I don't know why I waited so long to bring Alexa into my home. It's how I listen to my music now, dictate my shopping and to-do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few. I highly recommend this item.\n",
      "The show works great with my other products. Love it\n",
      "I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful\n",
      "Not sure will be keeping this. Worried about hacks that allow active mic.\n",
      "Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome\n",
      "Love our Echo show. A few enhancements we‚Äôd like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo. Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe.\n",
      "My whole family loves Alexa. We have the dots in all the bedrooms. I love the smart home features you can add. I love the music offered as a prime member. And when you‚Äôre bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book\n",
      "Love the echo show. Nice to have a visual. Love the drop in feature!\n",
      "Can use many differents apps from the Echo Show. Awesome product!\n",
      "I got this for a really good price. I already had the Echo Dot that I was kind of unimpressed with. I love the echo show. There are so many more things to do and the sound quality is great.\n",
      "I‚Äôve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made.\n",
      "Easy to set up. Plus, the screen is very clear and easy to view.\n",
      "Not sure I would like this, however, words to songs..Great and ability to view my outdoor and Indoor cameras is a plus. Still learning to use.\n",
      "Family is having fun with Alexa. I do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home: Arlo, Nest...\n",
      "Life amped! The features of this device have added a new dimension to our everyday routines. Pertinent and usable information by just simply asking. Superb product.\n",
      "Alexa show is easy to navigate. It‚Äôs wonderful having so much information at your finger tips.\n",
      "I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer. Got it as a gift and personally I love it. The speakers and sound from it are great. Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going, so you can karaoke without sucking now. Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with!\n",
      "I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things it's worth buying\n",
      "My daughter can‚Äôt wait to get this set up in her room\n",
      "Great product that a whole family would enjoy. It‚Äôs a perfect addition to the household.\n",
      "Great sounds! Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well! :)\n",
      "We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us.\n",
      "I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product\n",
      "You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good!\n",
      "Video calls work great and the screen is super informative.\n",
      "Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.\n",
      "I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.\n",
      "Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.\n",
      "We use it to talk to our granddaughter, play games, listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work! Awesome device! We already bought one for our kids also!\n",
      "First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.\n",
      "I got it for me and my brother for Christmas. Great gift. Great price. Very functional.\n",
      "Love device wrong color. Overall great device for Family.\n",
      "The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo.\n",
      "I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it!\n",
      "The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù\n",
      "Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!!\n",
      "Very impressed; set up a little confusing, but overall a good experience. Still learning. However, Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets !! Had to reset my account to a work email address.\n",
      "Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard.\n",
      "So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far.\n",
      "I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.\n",
      "I have several around the house and love playing music on them\n",
      "easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy. great way to keep in touch without a computer.\n",
      "Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.\n",
      "I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.\n",
      "Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it\n",
      "It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside.\n",
      "This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google's version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to.\n",
      "The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement\n",
      "Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it!\n",
      "Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea...........\n",
      "Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial\n",
      "Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather\n",
      "This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it.\n",
      "Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.\n",
      "It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn't play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos.\n",
      "The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app,\n",
      "I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time\n",
      "I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing!\n",
      "This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to \"try\" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home.\n",
      "This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product.\n",
      "Works well. Haven't been able to work out the local traffic yet.\n",
      "Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she's wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I'm going to have to buy another one.\n",
      "Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product\n",
      "Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.\n",
      "Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use\n",
      "This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.\n",
      "It's neat. It does what all other amazon alexis' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more.\n",
      "This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting.\n",
      "Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures.\n",
      "I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic!\n",
      "Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes.\n",
      "Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!!\n",
      "I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor.\n",
      "Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.\n",
      "Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.\n",
      "Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products\n",
      "Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music!\n",
      "Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.\n",
      "Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.\n",
      "This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.\n",
      "Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you.\n",
      "Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it\n",
      "This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal.\n",
      "The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.\n",
      "I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.\n",
      "It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.\n",
      "Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great.\n",
      "Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights\n",
      "I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.\n",
      "loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use.\n",
      "This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.\n",
      "I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms.\n",
      "I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too.\n",
      "Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music\n",
      "Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.\n",
      "I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.\n",
      "As advertised......................................\n",
      "I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information\n",
      "I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining\n",
      "I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.\n",
      "Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices\n",
      "I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.\n",
      "Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time\n",
      "Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product\n",
      "We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome!\n",
      "Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.\n",
      "I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa.\n",
      "Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features. We love using it to make phone calls, watch films, play Jeopardy, even to define words as they come up in conversation. We definitely get a lot of use out of this device, more than any other screen, tablet, or smart phone device we own.\n",
      "FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
      "A nice \"next step\" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use.\n",
      "It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function.\n",
      "I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.\n",
      "So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.\n",
      "this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product\n",
      "Simply love it! It‚Äôs loud... love watching videos!!\n",
      "This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it!\n",
      "I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!\n",
      "The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .\n",
      "This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain.\n",
      "Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.\n",
      "Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children's families during this holiday season!\n",
      "With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life.\n",
      "Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas!\n",
      "Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc√© and they love it. Works great with Phillips Hue\n",
      "I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn't \"relate\" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too!\n",
      "I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.\n",
      "We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite!\n",
      "Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls.\n",
      "Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about\n",
      "I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good.\n",
      "I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better\n",
      "I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly.\n",
      "Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful.\n",
      "Very impress with the echo show and all of its features\n",
      "I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line.\n",
      "This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw!\n",
      "Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation.\n",
      "The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be.\n",
      "If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product!\n",
      "The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show.\n",
      "I love this product! The possibilities are endless!\n",
      "It's great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend\n",
      "Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling.\n",
      "Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one!\n",
      "Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices.\n",
      "Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.\n",
      "I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn't liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon.\n",
      "Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis.\n",
      "The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.\n",
      "This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use\n",
      "I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information\n",
      "Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected.\n",
      "bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)...\n",
      "We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.\n",
      "Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube.\n",
      "Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.\n",
      "We're still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We're very pleased.\n",
      "The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.\n",
      "We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.\n",
      "Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use\n",
      "I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.\n",
      "Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.\n",
      "This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house.\n",
      "Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!\n",
      "This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!\n",
      "This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product\n",
      "I couldn't believe how easy and fast the setup was. It's basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don't need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose.\n",
      "Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better\n",
      "The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .\n",
      "Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.\n",
      "We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!\n",
      "I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time\n",
      "Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it\n",
      "Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo.\n",
      "Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great.\n",
      "This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.\n",
      "I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.\n",
      "This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.\n",
      "Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!\n",
      "After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices.\n",
      "Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day.\n",
      "I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.\n",
      "I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv.\n",
      "This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.\n",
      "Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line.\n",
      "Once you have it, you can't live without it. Great product.\n",
      "The show works great with my other products. Love it\n",
      "Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones.\n",
      "The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone\n",
      "All I really use it for is music. The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 24/7\n",
      "I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it!\n",
      "We're hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc.\n",
      "So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!\n",
      "I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends\n",
      "I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine\n",
      "Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home\n",
      "Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I'm really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display.\n",
      "I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices.\n",
      "Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly.\n",
      "The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .\n",
      "The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can \"drop in\" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog).\n",
      "Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show\n",
      "I‚Äôve always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup.\n",
      "Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling.\n",
      "Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.\n",
      "I use the echo show to stream music, video chat, and drop in as a camera from my home. You can even see recipes and other items. Worth the money, got it on sale! I always wait for sales.\n",
      "at first I wasnt sure if this was something I \"needed\" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I \"needed\" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.\n",
      "I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots\n",
      "I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE\n",
      "I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.\n",
      "With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family.\n",
      "Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.\n",
      "I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol\n",
      "The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better\n",
      "I‚Äôm all about the smart home and I love my new echo show. I stay more connected with my family. I also love how it‚Äôs integrated with my Arlo, Ring, Nest, and Hue light bulbs.\n",
      "Love this! We have it on our kitchen counter and great for music, news updates, amazon delivery updates, recipes, timer, and soo much more!\n",
      "Tech is not totally friendly but for The cost and what it does it is worth the investment\n",
      "Great product and it is very easy to set up and use\n",
      "Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?\n",
      "Works well with smart home lights, door locks and wireless security cam\n",
      "Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.\n",
      "Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.\n",
      "I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.\n",
      "I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product!\n",
      "It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.\n",
      "So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad. It's nice when I'm cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer. Over all it's a nice product, connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice.\n",
      "The Echo show is addictive. Pairs easy, fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable. Video calls work well. Great for the office or Kitchen.\n",
      "I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good.\n",
      "I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless.\n",
      "User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool\n",
      "This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking.\n",
      "Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen. Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly. Video selection could be better (somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video). It does have nice video for recipes.\n",
      "Amazon's Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast\n",
      "I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour.\n",
      "Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such.\n",
      "She knows all the answers. I‚Äôm used to speaking to her, i recently visiting a friend and said ‚ÄúAlexa ‚Äú. And my friend looked at me like I was crazy. She doesn‚Äôt have Alexa.\n",
      "It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen. Very convenient.\n",
      "Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.\n",
      "I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it.\n",
      "a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!\n",
      "with this echo line, we are able to watch amazon prime, and even do visual calls to grand daughter!\n",
      "Great to give as gifts. I bought several items for staff.\n",
      "I have several around the house and love playing music on them\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well.\n",
      "The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well. I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also. The Echo Show is the only way to go.\n",
      "The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other.\n",
      "I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.\n",
      "We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot\n",
      "I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....\n",
      "I. Like the visual with this echo although I think I would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa\n",
      "I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.\n",
      "We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!\n",
      "The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.\n",
      "Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!\n",
      "Staff was very helpful and polite ! Went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction!\n",
      "Absolutely love this. We got the lights and they have worked so great.\n",
      "Great Smart speaker for my 90 year old mother in law.\n",
      "I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it\n",
      "We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!\n",
      "Love the new echo show. has so many more features that my echo dot.\n",
      "I had been looking for the product for a while. After much research, I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is a great product. I can tell I won't be bored learning all that the echo show can do. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it.\n",
      "The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.\n",
      "Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates\n",
      "It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn't do Netflix, or Hulu, but that's okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It's easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid's goodnight, when I am working late.\n",
      "Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices.\n",
      "I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.\n",
      "Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I'm a new customer there\n",
      "The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.\n",
      "Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.\n",
      "Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.\n",
      "Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion).\n",
      "We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo's connect now in our home.\n",
      "I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.\n",
      "When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it.\n",
      "Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.\n",
      "We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun\n",
      "We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more. Love it!\n",
      "Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home\n",
      "Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.\n",
      "The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up\n",
      "I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine\n",
      "The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.\n",
      "I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.\n",
      "Added screen a great features visual effect a plus\n",
      "We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews\n",
      "I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.\n",
      "This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.\n",
      "I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that.\n",
      "I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies.\n",
      "I am totally Addicted.Easy to use. Love the call feature.\n",
      "The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!\n",
      "The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.\n",
      "Product is great. It is Easy to use and easy to set up\n",
      "This is a helpful addition to the home. It's great to be able to set timers, play music, and check the news all hands free.\n",
      "Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation.\n",
      "This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don't run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,\n",
      "Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.\n",
      "Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos\n",
      "First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.\n",
      "Great product will recommend it to friends and family.\n",
      "I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful\n",
      "The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away\n",
      "This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.\n",
      "great product with many functions I would highly recommend it to a friend.\n",
      "Device must be studied and practiced with to gain max use of its robust capacity .\n",
      "We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa, and home automation. After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the \"I can't answer that\" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say \"Alexa, Say good bye!\"\n",
      "This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Alexa can do it all! Having a severe hearing loss, the 'Show' gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying!\n",
      "The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.\n",
      "This is the only one you need ! it's like having the Dot, Echo and IHome all in one with a screen !\n",
      "So great to instantly see family members to chat, demonstrate, check-in... PLUS all the wonderful features of the Echo devices including video clips, movies, etc .\n",
      "It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites\n",
      "This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade.\n",
      "This is our second Show. And, one of several Christmas gifts. These are convenient and fun! Easy to set up. We use our Alexa devices as whole house intercom and for listening to music.\n",
      "I use Alexa every day. I do not know how I lived with out her before\n",
      "We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy\n",
      "Does exactly what we wanted it to do. Very easy voice commands.\n",
      "Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family\n",
      "Bought the eco show to replace my first gen eco (the original tube). The show hears and understands me a lot better.\n",
      "I love my Alexa Show. It can answer most of my questions and I use it for recipes and listening to music. I use it everyday.\n",
      "The screen is a great upgrade. Music lyrics are displayed with good quality speakers. Very convenient for recipes and you can make hands free calls with great audio quality. Great product!\n",
      "I bought the Echo Show because a friend of mine was excited about his. I'm hoping it makes a great Christmas present for our family.\n",
      "I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It's the perfect kitchen assistant.\n",
      "BUY IT !The video adds great value to the songs, news, etc.Also, accessing videos such as Netflix adds greatly.\n",
      "The echo show feels useless after a few hours, especially without the ability to watch YouTube.\n",
      "This device is especially useful if you know others who own it. It offers the same features as the standard Echo, along with an expanded feature set as well.\n",
      "My entire family loves this product. We ask her questions and go to sleep with her playing music. You feel like you have company anytime you want\n",
      "This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things.\n",
      "Got this for two days during the holidays. Very good service\n",
      "Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen.\n",
      "I love this thing! It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack\n",
      "Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc.\n",
      "Overall works well. Sound better than dot. Screen is clear.\n",
      "9the screen doesn't show as much as I thought it would but it works great and the speaker seems good on it.\n",
      "I haven‚Äôt used this yet, it is a gift for my father but I think he‚Äôll love it.\n",
      "I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.\n",
      "Video calls work great and the screen is super informative.\n",
      "I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :)\n",
      "Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item.\n",

      "Just an average Alexa option. Does show a few things on screen but still limited.\n",
      "The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!!\n",
      "I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good.\n",
      "I own multiple echoes and I like the show the best. The screen adds a lot of value in my opinion. I really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news. My kids like watching cartoons from Amazon Prime while eating breakfast. The speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size. At $149 it was a great deal.\n",
      "I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter !\n",
      "This one is the best...I have the dots but this is so nice if you have cameras just ask for that camera and you will get it on the screen.. spend the extra ..\n",
      "My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!!\n",

      "Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.\n",

      "I LOVE Alexa and my Echo device (and Smart Bulb) so much I bought 4 more Echos and 8 more bulbs with more to come soon...\n",
      "So I went to the store, purchased and gifted.it was a snap.\n",
      "Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands. Also very convenient music streaming, news and weather reports.\n",
      "We replaced our old echo for this one with a smart hub, works great\n",
      "It is a nice hub to use with lights and plugs. Sometimes echo does not work.\n",
      "Speaker was used as a giveaway and everyone wanted it! It was a huge hit at our conference. Would buy again.\n",
      "I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it.\n",
      "I like this smart machine and will recommend to my friends\n",

      "Great item, we love our Echo. If only she could mow the yard for the kids....\n",
      "Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful.\n",
      "We have sonos speakers and a Honeywell Lyric thermostat. It took a little searching on google to get things linked. Now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using Alexa.\n",
      "I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked.\n",
      "Alexa Is amazin. I love the features their great.Just love it\n",
      "This speaker is truly amazing and being able to control my lights makes it even better\n",
      "My new Echo Plus has been a fun find. It is working as advertised, and we are still exploring the many, many ways you can use this device. You do need some tech savvy on apps, wifi, and willingness to do some reading on the various \"skills\" but it is well worth it. Already added an Echo Dot to the mix.\n",
      "Love the knowledge it gives, and easy for my older brother who does. It so technology.\n",
      "I enjoy the amazon Alexa. It is an lot of fun. It will be more helpful once I have completely set up./\n",

      "Works great! I bought 2, 1 for the kitchen and 1 for master bath.\n",
      "I will definitely recommend this product . The tech support is also easy and friendly. Alexa keeps my husband company during the day answering his questions.\n",
      "I originally purchased this to use as a Bluetooth speaker for my wife's music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought. Ya, turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my Sony Google TV and more show up regularly. Makes it almost too easy to be lazy.\n",
      "Pretty fun little gadget. Kids love playing with it. Not even sure of all the things it can do yet\n",
      "I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.New toy!\n",
      "Bought 4 devices for my kids... they report its simple to start up, easy to use and fun!\n",
      "The ultimate lazy life is happening before my eyes. Now I love technology , always have . But let‚Äôs be honest , telling Alexa to turn the lights off and on and ask her to tell you a joke as examples . It really is great and I‚Äôm now addicted to the Hue line as well.\n",
      "Alexa ricks the plus is the best ever buy it you will love it\n",
      "Have yet to explore all the aspects. Enjoy using it daily.\n",
      "It is so fun to talk to Alexa, the sound is also very high quality, I am very happy with my purchase.\n",

      "Love being able to turn a light on when I walk inside with no hands! Alexa is a lifesaver\n",
      "So far I have used Alexa to play music. My only comment would be that I wish there was a larger variety of opera music.\n",
      "bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts.\n",
      "Echo is nice but it could be better allowing you to connect to anything that is on your WIFI network without having to buy several different hubs.\n",
      "I need to buy all the additional parts but it‚Äôs great\n",
      "I have enjoyed learning about home automation using Echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of Alexa.\n",
      "I love this product! I love everything about it!!!\n",
      "I have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves through time. Great quality speaker and build.\n",

      "This is such a great addition to our house! Amazon Echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing.\n",
      "We use Alexa to ask simple questions like - what time is the basketball game? and she usually responds correctly. If you ask a more detailed question, she may not have an answer. We like to play Jeopardy and listen to local radio stations using Alexa. I am sure the device will get better with more use and updates.\n",
      "Decided to go for the model just below this one. I didn't need the integrated \"hub\" features. (Phillips Hue does require this, but I decided to stick with my current Insteon hub).\n",
      "I love this product and it was one of my Best Buy‚Äôs from best buy\n",
      "Waste of money, ask Alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of I'm not sure.\n",
      "I love how Alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day. The music is connected directly to Amazon Prime Music and I love how the sound is clear and crisp. You can call out to Alexa from far away and she‚Äôll add items to your shopping list and the Alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things.\n",
      "I have an Echo that I bought from Best Buy several months ago. So when it came to buying one for my son & his family for Christmas I knew where to come. It‚Äôs an excellent information hub!\n",
      "Perfect start for smart home.works perfect with Echo\n",
      "I take 1 star off, because I had problems to syncing it with my W-FI.\n",
      "This was a great purchase! I love my echo plus with the hue light bulb. The set up is really easy and you can hook up your amazon account and order from Alexa. You can program your lights to be turned on at a certain time every day or even download the app and turn them on remotely. I love how this product is compatible with nest products.\n",
      "Good stereo sound, but will not control some devices without the use of an external hub.\n",
      "Easy to use no Complains at all. Added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect.\n",

      "I love having Alexa in my home. Alexa has helped from recipes to relaxing sleep sounds all night\n",

      "I also have the smaller echo and this sounds much better. Love all the features!\n",
      "They are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience. I don't have to turn off the lights and all I do is lay down and ask Alexa to turn off the light. All my lights are connected to my Echo Plus.\n",
      "My family have enjoyed ALEXA in the house, she is very smart and she does lots of research for the family! We are truly glad that we made the purchase\n",
      "Great entertainment when friends are over. The knowledge and jokes are tons of fun.\n",
      "This is the second one I‚Äôve bought this year for gifts\n",
      "This Alexa series 2 sounds better and preforms better than the previous model. It picks up the voices 10x better and the sound quality is on a Bose level(fills the whole room). Me and my family spends more quality time on the product!\n",
      "I have had the competitive products and nothing compares.\n",
      "Alexis is the new favorite name. Great for the college student\n",
      "Great Echo!! Friend really liked it!! It really does what he wants it to do and he connected his lights to the device. Everything works well.\n",

      "Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.\n",
      "I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products! Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb, we've purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and son's room. We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels.\n",
      "This was a present for my husband who originally had asked for a radio for his home office. He set it up relatively quick and was amazed at the sound quality. He loved the versatility and that he could have a specific radio station played or a random song as well as tell a joke, etc. It has been fun for all of us and we are looking into getting the smaller \"dots\" for other rooms now. He commented that he would NEVER get rid of this! It's very fun and functional. The Smart bulb is very handy as well. Love it!\n",
      "I have been contemplating purchasing an Echo product for some time now. I finally did it and I am so pleased I did. It was extremely easy to set up. I add my lights to the process and now it is so easy to turn lights on before I get to the room. For me, I know this will be the tip of the iceberg. I will now start looking at what else I can add to the Echo. Love the product. Great Buy!!!\n",
      "I got this for my husband. He likes it and the setup is easy.\n",
      "I wasn't sure I would use this item when I purchased it for my family.

      "A wonderful use of creativity and design, where installation was a breeze and use was pure enjoyment\n",
      "I purchased this as a second Alexa. Couldn't figure out why it came with the Hue Light bulb until I learned that the new version of Alexa has a built-in hub. It's a gift for my spouse, but I can't wait to set it up and get more bulbs to automate our home lighting.\n",
      "Great addition to all the other electronics in our home\n",
      "Bought the Amazon - Echo Plus + Philips Hue Bulb - Black for my kitchen it is awesome also came with free smart bulb.\n",
      "Love my Echo Plus, echo, echo spot and Ech show. Very satisfied with the products. They work great individually or with each other.\n",

I‚Äôm so happy with these purchases and learning so much with Alexa. You can start your daily routine with Alexa and program it to whatever you would like to include news weather music horoscope ALSO you can start your day off with a compliment and I think is very important. Alexa gave me the BEST CHILI RECIPE I MEAN THE BEST it‚Äôs called Chili I. I want my husband to use Alexa to stay organized for business dates and reminders. This is the way to go\n",

      "Great device, but I noticed based on the WiFi connection that Alexa can react slower at times. Especially when asking the device to turn off bulbs, or any smart devices.\n",
      "It's nice to be able to listen to music in the morning and setting reminders is extremely helpful and I love being able to operate my light bulb remotely\n",
      "Took it out of the box and played with it for a while. Then I lost connection with it and now it no longer recognizes my phone #. Called Amazon they said they would work on the problem, no call back yet.\n",

I purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities. Just to name a few of those capabilities. With a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to, that in itself was worth it. Some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic. The home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation..\n",
      "We love Alexa! Great addition to our family! Lol But seriously, you can rely on Alexa....\n",

      "Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door.

      "Salesman told me the big one was better so I bought it. My daughter gave me the small one for Christmas. Does the same thing. Salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars!\n",

      "If you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you!\n",

      "The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy. We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out. Wow! are we impressed! We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room, family room, and bedroom. Also it can dim the lights more than once. Need the local weather forecast, just ask. Want to listen to Christmas music? Yes, again. Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country, yes! We're still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless. Absolutely love this!!\n",

I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing. Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo. Just got it so time will tell, but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it.\n",
      "Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue. Great sound and voice recognition.\n",
      "Loud speaker, very responsive. Makes it easier that the smart hub is built into it than having to buy another piece of equipment.\n",

      "Very easy to setup. Had no issues at all . Nice having hub inside . Bulb sync was a breeze\n",

      "We returned it. Could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google.\n",

      "awesome product my wife and I love it makes home automation simple\n",
      "We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus's speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus.\n",
      "I bought this for my brother and his wife. They love it! Not only does it control their Nest thermostat, it works with their expanding environment of Philips Hue bulbs.\n",

      "Purchased the product for a gift. Has not been used yet\n",
      "We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off.\n",
      "It made a great Christmas present for my wife. Plus...I get it too...Works great. Great order and delivery from Best Buy.\n",
      "Great item for controling your lights in my home even when I'm away.\n",
      "This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly!\n",
      "The echo is great for choosing music and getting information. The voice is very soothing.\n",
      "Easy to set up. Performs well. Nice Product For The Money\n",
      "Bought this Echo for my wife. She loves how just by speaking she can listen to any type of music. It sounds pretty good too.\n",
      "I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot. I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it. I am not nearly able to make use of it yet. But...it does look exciting if I ever get there.\n",
      "The built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices. The larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice!!\n",
      "I love Alexa...She has become my best friend. Thanks\n",
      "Kind of hard adding smart items but when you do it‚Äôs nice to just talk and not get on computer or smart phone to control\n",
      "I really enjoy the sound. It sounds so full. My only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub. I had to purchase the Hue Hub to get full functionality. Other than that, I love it.\n",
      "Great Christmas gift! The hubby loved it . Just read the manual before setting up!!\n",
      "It's awesome. Feels like \"company.\" Takes commands on the first try and the sound fills the room beautifully! My guests love it too!\n",

      "Love this combination package I got while on sale. Amazon Echo Plus is responsive and easy to use. Great sound quality. Easy to integrate with other services such as the Hue Bulb. Just need to get more bulbs to complete my setup.\n",
      "I like being able to turn on lights, music and the thermostat in our home!\n",
      "Alexa is awesome to have at home makes things fun and easy\n",
      "I have an Amazon Prime account so I started downloading apps and playing all kinds of music on this. I also can control my Hue hub (you need one for certain timers and things) and Wemo plus outlets for my non wifi lights and LED's in the kitchen cabinets.\n",
      "I bought this for my Mom for Christmas and ended up she got me one too! Great for everyone, speaker sounds great easy to set up and my Mom ended up getting the dot so she could have her light turned on from downstairs and then tell Alexa to turn it off while in bed. No regrets on this one!\n",
      "I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs.\n",
      "Love the echo plus. Easy to set up with comparable extras, has simplified so many things in my home. Takes some getting to use to but patience and practice and males all the difference.\n",

      "Great product. Didnt realize it‚Äôs compatible with different items\n",
      "We use Alexa for so many things. We use it for shopping list, music, lights on or off, even Trivia games.\n",
      "Christmas gift for my son and my husband. Can‚Äôt wait to hook it up\n",
      "Works great and we like like the light that came with it., Not one issues so far!\n",
      "My wife and I love the Amazon echo plus it‚Äôs very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up I would recommend this to anybody we love it. We also play a lot of music on it.\n",
      "We never received the light bulb. Very happy with Alexa just not happy that the bulb was not sent.\n",
      "It has very limited use without adding on expensive Apps or adding more wireless speakers. I am considering returning the merchandise\n",
      "Bought this for my son and one for my husband and me. So easy to set up. Very helpful. Doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space.\n",
      "When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds, Amazon Echo was more of ECHO-Ing, tin can complex... at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos. Echo Plus you ask... Not so much!!! This device has such excellent sound!! One of the best devices I have ever purchased! If I could I would have these all over my house. Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen. Echo plus is the way to go!!! Beautiful device, sounds is second to none!\n",
      "Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!!\n",
      "Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects.\n",
      "I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.\n",
      "Worked right out of the box easy set up and operation\n",
      "Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights.\n",
      "Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.\n",

      "I have the Echo plus and i love it the speakers sounds loud and clear.\n",
      "Bought for my husband for Christmas. We keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music. But our kids love that they can tell Alexa to play a song they like and it plays\n",
      "I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt.\n",
      "One For Us One For The Kids For Christmas!Great way to get connected!\n",
      "This Amazon Echo is the COOLEST gadget you can buy, it is VERY SMART and learns very fast. it runs many items in our home IE Nest, LG TV, Lights\n",
      "The device is extremely useful for all those who choose to have a smart/connected home. The built-in hub helps you to connect your devices easier than not having it. I would recommend this device especially if you have a prime membership.\n",
      "This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do!\n",
      "Speaker has great sound and it‚Äôs awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub.\n",
      "This is my second Alexa and the second time set up so much easier. I love the extra volume for my music and the peer to peer calling gives me a mini hands free intercom. Still discovering the new features.\n",
      "I loved my echo so much I bought my sister one. I can now turn on my lights when I get home just by asking Alexa.\n",
      "Is great, fun, useful. Great speaker. Kids love it.\n",
      "I really like how she is able to interact and plays music with great sound. She interacts with my smart home.\n",
      "Got this model only because of the sale price and the built in hub that controls my hue strip lights. And....I didn‚Äôt want to say google all the time! Sounds like baby talk to me....lol\n",
      "Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had, plus better sound and built-in capability for Smart Home add-ons, like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs ‚Äî without needing a Hue hub or ST hub. Love it!\n",
      "I am not a tech person, but I was able to easily connect these devices to my network\n",
      "This was out first time using any of Amazons alexa products and we love it. So far we have the hue light bulbs and fire stick but plan on updating the front door lock and thermostat. So easy to use and convenient.\n",
      "Very easy to set up! Easy to connect with multiple Amazon Echo Dots, as well as multiple smart home products.\n",
      "Worked fine first time out of the box. Plug it in, set it up with you Amazon account and you are ready to go. It is very convenient to turn on and off the Phillips light by voice.\n",
      "I love being able to use Alexa. She is an amazing AI. Until the robots rebel against the human kind I think it‚Äôs worth it.\n",

      "Great product, easier set up than anticipated. Actually bought for my Mother - she loves it.\n",
      "I love amazon products, easy to use and install. I recommend them 100%. very good sound and above all price\n",
      "I like being able to ask about the weather, set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking Elexia.\n",
      "From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs.\n",
      "You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music\n",
      "Works great. Can‚Äôt wait to find all it can do for me.\n",
      "Asking trivia questions of Alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden.\n",
      "Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.\n",
      "Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone\n",
      "I really like this product. My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items. So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights. It works great. I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom. I love that it has a great built in speaker. I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time.....\n",
      "Bought for a family memeber and he was so happy with the game\n",
      "I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home\n",
      "Alexa really amazes me. She learns new skills everyday.\n",
      "I‚Äôm still trying to get it set up but so far it‚Äôs a blast!\n",
      "We like using the Echo. Probably didn't need the plus because we are just using it to play music on Amazon music.\n",
      "I was skeptical about the Amazon Echo products. Why would I need this? I bought the Echo Dot first and was hooked. Bought this Echo Plus for smart home integration. Since then, I have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more \"things\", I bought an Echo Spot, too. You do not need an Echo product, but they are fun, practical and cool. Can't live without it now!\n",
      "A fun little device on the cutting edge of consumer artificial intelligence. Sp aker sounds pretty good. Alexa does have some problems understanding how I ask questions a fair amount of the time.\n",
      "I was wishing I good set it up to my pool equipment.\n",
      "Excellent item... above and beyond my expectations\n",
      "It works great and is easy too use. The salesman was a tremendous help.\n",

      "great sound. Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it.\n",
      "My home is about 80% automated with help from ALEXA...We want to have one in each room.\n",
      "I really purchased this for my wife to use as a Bluetooth speaker knowing that maybe we would find something else for it to do. I'm glad I did, now. We have Christmas tree lights going off and on, lamps dimming at precise measures, \"Alexa, light 30 percent\", and am looking at the other many, many things that this can do. It's easy to setup, too.\n",
      "Easy to set up. We really enjoy getting real time local weather. It translates Spanish very efficiently. We also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound. Linking the Echo to lighting is a snap. Highly recommended!\n",
      "LOVE it. Never had one before. Easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Alexa works pretty good, music sounds good. Just exploring all her skills\n",
      "i have really enjoyed my new echo plus.i enjoy music every morning with the news\n",

      "this is so much better than the echo dot. the smart hub is pretty cool\n",

      "I already have Alexa at home and since it was on sale, made a nice christmas gift..\n",
      "It works well and sounds decent, but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as Samsung.\n",
      "This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party. She loves it, especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights & her nest thermostat. This has also gone over well with the Grand Children.\n",
      "Echo plus seems to work as they say. I have it running two lights so far. Plan on setting up seven more. Nice product.\n",
      "Alexa items are easy to use and set up. Works easily with the smart plug and bulb.\n",
      "This is the music lovers best friend. My wife and kids love asking Alexa to play ANY song. The sound quality is great\n",
      "Seamlessly control your house, tell Alexa to turn on your favorite music, and play games. Not much else you could ask for, especially for the price!\n",
      "I received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office. This year I decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features I hadn‚Äôt taken advantage of. Primarily the smart home features. This was great because it came with a lightbulb.\n",
      "I was a bit reluctant to jump on the Alexa wagon, but now that I have, I don‚Äôt know why! This is awesome. Still figuring out all the things I can do but only because there are so many!\n",

      "Great sound quality. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Looks good too.\n",

      "Easy to set up and pair other compatible items by enabling skills through the Amazon app. I've been to best buy twice for information and how to questions and all seems to be going well. It's only been a week and still have a lot to learn about Elexa's capabilities\n",

      "As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes.\n",

      "I wondered about buying one before making the decision - now even after just a few weeks I wonder how I managed. It has some gimmicky things yes but also can help out with a lot of very useful ideas such as weather, traffic and lists. Would recommend one to anyone\n",
      "Bought eh Echo Plus on a whim - it was on sale and I figured, \"why not.\" I am really enjoying it. Apart form the basic news and weather reporting, I enjoy my morning trivia. I also use the music from Amazon a lot. It's been nice having a \"holiday\" station at my disposal. The Echo Plus is easy to set up and use and definitely has a lot of features, many of which I am still learning.\n",
      "Love this product, super easy to use and able to have a lot of fun with this with entertaining guests and ourselves.\n",
      "It has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo\n",
      "Bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it. Makes her feel like she is a tech wiz. Makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes. More importantly, she is in her 70s and Iives alone, she can make a phone call using Alexa from anywhere she has an echo. I bought her 3 to cover her whole house. This means if she falls down and can‚Äôt get to her phone she can dial me or 911 with her voice.....a must have!!!\n",
      "Still figuring out what all I can do with it but the Echo was extremely easy to hook up. The instructions that came with it made everything very clear. The speaker doesnt get room filling loud if you want to play music but thankfully it has an audio out jack so I just hooked it up to some speakers.\n",
      "Surprisingly useful. Ben 2 Echo is much better than Gen 1. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "We love the new Echo! So easy to set up and use!!!\n",
      "Alexa usually works well but it has turned on things when I did not tell it to.\n",
      "its a lot of fun playing with alexa comands the speakers sound great. i'm glad i purchase it.\n",
      "I love this product would really recommend to any one!\n",
      "Love being able to set a timer, play music and turn in my Wi-Fi connected lamp without moving from my couch.\n",
      "This has got to be the best electronic purchase I‚Äôve made in recent months! Easy to set up, so many skills to enable, Alexa knows it all! The range is about 30 feet for it to hear and recognize my voice. Be sure to speak clearly. Great purchase, and exceeds my expectations. Works great with my iOS devices too!\n",
      "This may be an incremental upgrade to the original Amazon Echo but is definitely worth it. Miles ahead from Google Home.\n",
      "As I made my home a smart home I know I know I made a smart choice with Amazon Echo and Philips light bulbs. I'm looking forward to adding more smart gadgets to my collection.\n",
      "The light came free with the Echo (didn‚Äôt know) but now that I have that one I want to get all my lights like this one! It‚Äôs so great and convenient to be able to tell it to turn off right before I leave the room instead of having to walk over there to pull the cord. Or even better when you forget to turn the switch off before you sit down, that‚Äôs the worst!\n",
      "Love asking Alexis all kinds of questions and listening to great Amazon Music!!!!\n",
      "Very easy to set up.Changed how I do a lot of things.\n",
      "Pretty cool product.Features are limited unless you spend a lot more money buying other things you can connect and interface with. But the basic unit with one lightbulb is a pretty good start. Just know going into it that you will be shelling out a lot more to expand the system.\n",
      "The sound of the Echo Plus is good, and the matte black color looks stylish. The Phillips Hugh Bulb that was included with my purchase is nice and convenient.\n",
      "Purchased as a gift for my 14 year old son. He absolutely loves it. Uses to place music, ask questions and turn off his lights!\n",
      "Still learning what all she can do but it definitely makes life easier.\n",
      "She could perform some tasks ,but most things she didn't know. So agrivating.\n",
      "We love the Echo II. Its an awesome product. Great price too\n",
      "My husband loves the ability to listen to anything and to be able to run the living room light when he comes in instead of trying to find the light switch.\n",
      "I have been greatly impressed with the Alexa. A friend loves calling me and asking her Alexa questions. We share alot of laughs just discovering all the things she can do. So I just had to purchase an Alexa for myself. I'm just beginning set my Alexa up. I hope it's easy because I'm not tech. salve. I've got to go and get started with the set-up.\n",
      "I mainly bought the Echo plus for my kids but I‚Äôm using it more than they do. Excellent product!!\n",
      "I purchased this, in addition to several other Alexa products, because I wanted the hub to connect several smart home devices. So far it has been pretty easy to set up and use. I'm happy with the sound also.\n",
      "As advertised. Easy set up and integration. Haven't tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2.\n",
      "Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product. Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa.\n",
      "I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in, it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason.\n",
      "I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker\n",
      "like the Alexa but needs to be more interactive like suri.\n",
      "Enjoying using Alexa.... and love the smart home features.\n",
      "Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.\n",
      "I have not had a chance to use the HUB function on this device, but it was easy to set up and get running, still learning how to make it work with the other echo devices, but overall it operates as advertised.\n",
      "It is nice to say one set of key words, and it kicks off a whole series of events. (Turn lights on, play music etc).\n",
      "I‚Äôm a big Apple consumer all around but after tons of research and testing, I went to alexa over Siri (Apple home kit) to make my full home a smart house.\n",
      "Like the idea of having a built-in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them.Sound quality is marginally better, but we didn't buy Echos as audiophiles...but for background music and it's perfect for that.My only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other. That makes it frustrating for the other user (particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms).\n",
      "I love my Echo so much. I have my lights and front door deadbolt hooked up to it. I play music from it all the time and ask Alexa about the traffic and weather. I would recommend the Echo to everyone.\n",
      "Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself. It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker. It's so convenient to ask/request without touch anything. The response time is acceptable but you need to speak out your question right after calling Alex or it won't wait.\n",
      "Great product. Loving alexa! Was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do.\n",
      "My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.\n",

      "Bought as a Christmas gift. Works good with no problems\n",
      "Our entire family loves Alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters.\n",
      "Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times\n",
      "Love listening to music and having it turn my light on and off\n",

      "Very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music.\n",
      "I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Echo from the day it was released to the market. Unfortunately the volume control wheel broke. I quickly went over to my local best buy and purchased the next generation. There are amazing improvements concerning this device. I Really And Truly Are In Love With Alexa. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her\n",

      "I never thought that buying this product was such a great step up. Really makes watching a movie and turning on the TV so easy, really works well with my harmony hub. Love the way I can control all the lights. Looking forward to all the add ons, I can purchase.\n",
      "I love this. Has great sound. I thought i bought in silver. THe packaging was a little deceptive. But I'm loving it. Wanting to get a second one.\n",
      "makes things easy to control. connects to other products\n",
      "It‚Äôs my first Alexa and I love it nice sound and smart light acts fast with command\n",
      "I love Alexa. Has a pretty good speaker for listening toMusic and helps with my shopping lists.\n",
      "Nice addition to the home but not essential; would recommend as a gift and although I like t I could definitely live without it\n",
      "Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints.\n",
      "I love it, the sound is great. I use it everyday for my dogs to listen to when I am at work.\n",
      "I have an original Gen 1 Echo that has been relocated to My Bedroom by simply unplugging and Plugging back in!Now that I have the Gen 2 Echo Plus in my Living Room and set up to work seamlessly with my Gen 1 I could not be happier. Along with the built in Hue it makes it that much better. Everything works just like I want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me.\n",
      "this is my first experience with Alexa. hard to command, I guess because this is my first time. I did have to reset because she stopped working. I am reading up on Alexa more so I‚Äôll know how to command her.\n",
      "This purchase is replacing an echo for that is being moved to a bedroom. The sound is far superior to the dot (which has decent sound). The echos just keep getting better and more useful.\n",
      "To use. Putting in after Christmas. Want all lights on voice activation.\n",
      "This is great. It's a lot of fun and much better than I expected\n",

      "So much fun, love it...........................................................\n",
      "I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the technology. It‚Äôs a little annoying having to say Alexa all the time. I‚Äôve purchases the links for the outlets and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs really good for since the bulbs were too dim for me.\n",
      "Bought for mother, she loves it! Good price, in stock, and an easy purchase.\n",

      "Friend received Amazon Echo as gift & is enjoying it. I researched & decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting. Absolutely love this product! It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting. Other features, weather, news briefs, traffic are fun, but the lighting control did it for me.\n",
      "Amazon and Philips Hue work great together. very easy setup. The only drawback is using these bulbs on a non-Philips dimmer switch. The bulbs flicker a bit, even when it's set to full on\n",
      "This is a neat little toy. It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa.\n",
      "Kinda bummed didn‚Äôt realize I bought the package and didn‚Äôt get my extra Phillips hue bulb. But I love the echo plus with the hub! Great product. Just annoyed that the sales guy at Best Buy didn‚Äôt make sure I knew I also got a free bulb with my purchase.\n",
      "If you want to control your light, tv..ect with just your voice Alexa can do that and much more\n",
      "I have had this for around a month and i love it. It makes it simple to set timers and control my lights\n",
      "I use Alexa for a alarm clock, turning on lights when I get home and I love listening to any genre of music!!\n",
      "The speaker is loud enough to cover my room but I still connect external speakers. The hub portion of the device works well, although I wish it had more capabilities when it comes to controlling hue lighting.\n",
      "super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it\n",
      "I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.\n",
      "This works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two.\n",

      "This is a must, excellent technology. Great design and sleek looks. I am very happy with unit.\n",
      "This thing works great! I would recommend to all of my friends. Should have bought one sooner. We listen to music non stop now.\n",
      "This doesn't require separate speakers and has great sound\n",
      "Love this thing ! I have linked it to my Hue System and my Fire TV. I ask her and she does it. Fun to play games also. My wife was sceptical but now she uses it more than me\n",
      "I like the looks of the Echo Plus and the sound from the speakers is something I didn‚Äôt expect to be as nice as it is. I‚Äôm using it to tune into my favorite radio station, answer any question I have to look up on the internet and assist me with lighting. I am considering another for a different room.\n",
      "My son loves it. He now wants to add more for Alexa to use.\n",

      "Well, I bought this on a lark. And to my surprise, I'm using it all day long to get the news alerts, check the weather, and listen to music. Works well, and even understands my relatively heavy southern accent.\n",
      "I went into the store looking for a Bluetooth speaker for music and left with this. Works great and sounds good.\n",
      "nice and compact, great sound, easy to use, love it.\n",

      "Love having the Echo to get quick weather reports, play music, and other helpful information.\n",

      "Love how it hooks up to lights. And can play any music\n",

      "It works pretty well. I wish there's was an instruction book with it instead of having to go online. Plus I didn't know you had to pay for music and it doesn't listen very well like it said it would.\n",

      "This is one of Good item bought for my 2017 Thanksgiving deals\n",
      "I wanted to try out this technology. It is cool. Sometimes, I would prefer not to hear Alexa's reply when I ask her to turn the light on.\n",
      "I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products.\n",
      "Solid Amazon Echo, love they have added Phillips Hub into the product so you do not need a hub. Voice response is a little touchy compared to other Echos.\n",

      "The Echo Plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub. It is easy to setup, fast and responsive, has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily, and looks and sounds great. I currently use mine to manage my smart ‚Äúthings‚Äù like light bulbs, lamps, smart switches, and even my robot vac. It has made automating a lot of what I do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where I didn‚Äôt know it needed to be simplified!Definitely worth the extra money to go with the Plus over the Echo or the Dot.\n",
      "i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses. i thought initially music, but now to get weather updates, news, receipies, sports scores, and ordering kitchen supplies.\n",

      "The Echo Plus is great. ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù is the best feature. The only problem is, you can‚Äôt use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying.\n",

      "Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit.\n",
      "Exchanged the google Google home for this model. Fun for the kids. Finding new uses for it every day. Had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb.\n",
      "The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though.\n",
      "Love the sound I am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated!\n",
      "This product is amazing! I wasn't quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one, but now that it's in my house I cannot imagine life without it. Alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information, but now she controls the lights of my house for me! I highly recommend this!\n",
      "I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus. Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub. Very satisfied with its performance.\n",
      "Easy setup. They are adding new commands every week it seems. Still has some work till it is fully functional.\n",
      "They make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to Alexa but she never knows anything. It is very non responsive at times too.\n",
      "It‚Äôs fun for the family to play with, but it may get boring after the newness wears off. We‚Äôll see.\n",
      "My first Alexa product and I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome\n",
      "Great and fun , almost like having someone in the room with you\n",
      "I love the Alexa. It has encouraged me to automate my home. Now I have lighting that comes on when I ask, My heat is controlled wherever I am and it's fun asking her (Alexa) questions.\n",
      "She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.\n",
      "Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice\n",
      "Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings\n",
      "Alexa rocks. The Echo Plus is super easy to set up. I works great. Love everything about it. Adding more devices.\n",
      "we bought this as a gift for our son. he is absolutely loving it.\n",
      "This is a great way to begin making your home a smart home. Easy to set up, built in hub, easy to use.\n",
      "I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours.\n",
      "This solved the problem of my daughter's lost kindle charger.\n",
      "I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable.\n",
      "Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.\n",
      "I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!\n",
      "Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!\n",
      "I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/\n",
      "Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up.\n",
      "Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package\n",
      "just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.\n",
      "Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable\n",
      "This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily\n",
      "Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone.\n",
      "Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.\n",
      "After purchasing 2 different \"brand X\" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price!\n",
      "Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire\n",
      "Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn't have to.\n",
      "Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.\n",
      "Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger.\n",
      "pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand\n",

      "I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.\n",
      "You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.\n",
      "This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child\n",
      "Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.\n",
      "I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top\n",
      "Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.\n",
      "very good product and service will refer a friend.\n",
      "It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.\n",
      "Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too.\n",
      "I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go.\n",
      "My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.\n",
      "My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.\n",
      "My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.\n",
      "Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas.\n",
      "For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc\n",
      "I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this\n",
      "Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too.\n",
      "UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me\n",
      "My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books\n",
      "My wife loves to read, but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter, easier to hold, can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing, namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED's are a nice touch.\n",
      "I am using it for my 3 year old and she loves it..\n",
      "Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.\n",

      "Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy.\n",
      "My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome\n",

I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come\n",
      "bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use\n",
      "Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter.\n",
      "My son just love playing games on this tablet. Its easy and fun!\n",
      "I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all.\n",
      "I highly recommend this product for children with special needs\n",
      "Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!\n",

      "Aiden's is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers\n",
      "You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.\n",
      "We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too.\n",
      "This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone.\n",
      "Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.\n",
      "My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives.\n",
      "Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale\n",
      "I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.\n",
      "Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too\n",

      "Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK\n",
      "My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books\n",
      "I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don't know what they did to theirs because mines doesn't have any issues... I've had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday...\n",
      "It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.\n",

      "she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it\n",
      "This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.\n",
      "I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance\n",

      "I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting!\n",
      "Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my mother. Her first tablet and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate.\n",

      "I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see.

      "for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it\n",

      "This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus\n",
      "It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!\n",

      "Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it\n",
      "My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.\n",
      "Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.\n",

      "I had the 4th generation. I am quite happy with the upgrade. Good battery life\n",
      "my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price\n",
      "Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!\n",
      "We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.\n",
      "The product is very durable and is great for children\n",
      "Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.\n",
      "Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts\n",
      "Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!\n",
      "It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.\n",

      "it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price\n",
      "Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.\n",
      "Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.\n",
      "It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.\n",
      "Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks\n",
      "So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too\n",
      "After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.\n",

      "Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store.\n",
      "I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed.\n",
      "The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight.\n",

      "You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 2 year old it's ok\n",

      "Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.\n",
      "My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.\n",
      "My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free\n",

      "This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.\n",

      "Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well\n",
      "Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books.\n",
      "Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users.\n",

      "Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.\n",
      "Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me.\n",
      "Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy\n",
      "My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.\n",
      "reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use\n",
      "My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.\n",
      "I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.\n",
      "This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced.\n",
      "This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.\n",
      "I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.\n",
      "My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.\n",
      "This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!\n",
      "My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!\n",
      "Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.\n",
      "I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.\n",
      "This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps\n",
      "My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.\n",
      "this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it\n",
      "I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.\n",

      "The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!\n",
      "My wife loves to read, but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter, easier to hold, can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing, namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED's are a nice touch.\n",
      "it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok\n",
      "Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.\n",
      "I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.\n",

      "This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster.\n",
      "It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps\n",
      "This kindle allows me to download several books. It easily fits in a purse and is light weight\n",
      "Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.\n",

We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.\n",
      "Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy\n",
      "I purchased this as a replacement for my older Kindle. It is excellent as always but I also noticed very little new features or updates since my last Kindle model. Would have liked some more design, form factor, or feature changes. That being said, it fits the bill and is amazingly light, so I have no other complaints.\n",

      "My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an \"iPad\", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial.\n",
      "Great product and reasonable price! Suitable for everyday use\n",
      "I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own.

      "Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .\n",
      "This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two.\n",
      "Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!\n",
      "I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!\n",
      "I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though.\n",
      "Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price.\n",
      "Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids\n",
      "Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed.

I got the blue!\n",

      "Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it.\n",

      "Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though\n",

      "This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.\n",
      "Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item.\n",
      "Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features\n",
      "this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.\n",
      "Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school\n",

      "This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.\n",
      "The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain.\n",
      "The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading\n",
      "If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!\n",

      "Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.\n",
      "This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the \"Kids Edition\" box was not registered as a \"Kids Edition\" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the \"Kids Edition\" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a \"Kids Edition\" so it was returned.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal.\n",
      "My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well.\n",
      "For two girls that love to play games and take with them\n",

      "My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!\n",

      "I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It's easy to use and the perfect size for his hands.\n",
      "This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.\n",
      "Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.\n",
      "My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.\n",

      "Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.\n",
      "I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts\n",
      "This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it\n",
      "I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!\n",
      "The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!!\n",

      "Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this\n",

      "Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it.\n",
      "I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+.\n",
      "My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!\n",

      "When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet.\n",
      "i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read\n",
      "I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.\n",

      "This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.\n",
      "I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this.\n",
      "I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.\n",
      "Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.\n",
      "easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS\n",
      "This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps\n",

      "The graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected!\n",
      "It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.\n",
      "I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.\n",
      "i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.\n",
      "Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls\n",
      "Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!\n",
      "I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.\n",
      "I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.\n",
      "The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.\n",
      "I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is \"Mom, you are the best\", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!\n",
      "Great price! Kids love it. Lots of space for apps!\n",
      "Very small in size, not exactly what I had thought but yet good product for the price I paid\n",
      "I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.\n",
      "I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.\n",
      "Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won't put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great.\n",
      "Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now.\n",
      "Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok\n",
      "This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It's very durable and he loves it!!\n",
      "Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2\n",
      "This tab is great for kids and parents alike. I recommend this product to others.\n",
      "I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.\n",
      "I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.\n",
      "This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use.\n",

      "Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it!\n",
      "Item work well and was easy to read from in day light\n",
      "When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!\n",
      "I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!\n",
      "My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.\n",
      "Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!\n",
      "Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!\n",
      "This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it\n",
      "This e-reader meets all expectations and has a good feel to it.\n",

      "This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size.\n",
      "Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and she loves it.\n",
      "It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.\n",
      "I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!\n",
      "Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier\n",
      "The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.\n",
      "Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........\n",
      "My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.\n",
      "My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.\n",
      "Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.\n",

      "My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great\n",
      "Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device\n",
      "This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet.\n",
      "I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.\n",
      "It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her.\n",
      "The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.\n",
      "Got it for my grandson he loves it.it is a very good tablet!!!\n",
      "The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use.\n",

      "Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.\n",
      "This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added.\n",
      "My granddaughter really likes it. \"She\" found age-appropriate games to play.\n",
      "Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics.\n",
      "I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!\n",
      "The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it\n",
      "My daughter loves the Amazon Fire tablet that I purchased for her!\n",
      "My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old\n",

Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!\n",
      "Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free\n",
      "Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend\n",
      "Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer.\n",
      "My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!\n",
      "Great tablet for kids. Big choice of apps, great price.\n",
      "I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.\n",
      "Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great\n",
      "I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.\n",
      "Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it\n",
      "Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.\n",
      "Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable\n",
      "The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.\n",
      "Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better.\n",
      "I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!\n",
      "If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!\n",
      "Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!\n",
      "My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.\n",
      "Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product\n",
      "Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.\n",
      "My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.\n",
      "This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.\n",
      "The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.\n",
      "This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!\n",
      "Works great for my daughter, great price and apps.\n",
      "My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy\n",

      "Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.\n",
      "Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.\n",
      "This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier\n",
      "My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.\n",
      "I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.\n",
      "Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.\n",
      "I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju\n",
      "It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.\n",

      "this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover\n",
      "My kid loves this! It was one of his favorite Christmas presents.\n",
      "I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.\n",
      "I love to read but don't have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later.\n",

      "I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader.\n",
      "I originally got the lower end Kindle, took it back and upgraded. The light really is a must. I can't believe how much more I'm reading now that I have it, and there are TONS of free books out there if you know where to look. Best. Purchase. EVER.\n",

      "Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.\n",
      "The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect.\n",

      "At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids.\n",

      "This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.\n",

      "Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.\n",

      "Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.\n",
      "I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....\n",
      "Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!\n",
      "The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.\n",
      "I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.\n",

      "The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.\n",
      "I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.\n",
      "I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase.\n",

      "My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.\n",
      "So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine.\n",
      "It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.\n",
      "I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great.

      "I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!\n",
      "This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.\n",
      "I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.\n",
      "Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!\n",
      "This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase.\n",
      "I love my new e-reader!! I am enjoying all my books in one place.\n",
      "I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.\n",

      "I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time.\n",
      "Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5\" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great\n",
      "We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this\n",
      "Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.\n",

      "Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.\n",
      "I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.\n",
      "Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.\n",

      "This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected.\n",
      "I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.\n",
      "I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands.\n",
      "I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.\n",
      "This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad.\n",
      "I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.\n",
      "I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days.

      "I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.\n",
      "grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use\n",
      "My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great\n",
      "This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.\n",
      "Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.\n",
      "Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids\n",
      "My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it.\n",
      "I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.\n",
      "Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.\n",
      "meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.\n",
      "Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.\n",
      "My granddaughter loves it! Long battery and is tough.She loves all the games and she learning so muchEveryday.\n",
      "Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!\n",
      "I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc.\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.\n",
      "Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product.\n",
      "Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it\n",
      "I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.\n",
      "Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.\n",
      "My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.\n",
      "I love that this tablet came preloaded. All we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level.\n",
      "I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.\n",
      "Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.\n",
      "for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!\n",
      "Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my grandfather. He was excited when he opened it and will get great use out of it while he is in doors for winter.\n",
      "it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good.\n",
      "Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.\n",
      "I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.\n",
      "This is a great entry tablet, if you do not want to dish out a few hundred dollars you should look into a fire table.\n",
      "This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive.\n",
      "This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.\n",
      "The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket.\n",
      "This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7\" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well.\n",
      "It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.\n",
      "Good to use it to read books under light.the price is lower than other website.\n",
      "Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.\n",
      "Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great.\n",
      "This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.\n",
      "I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.\n",
      "Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.\n",
      "Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids\n",
      "Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet.\n",
      "My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.\n",
      "This is all around a great tablet. My 1yr old can use it with ease. Also love how we can change the profiles to suit adults as well. Would recommend to anyone and all ages.\n",
      "This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color!\n",
      "My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly\n",
      "This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.\n",
      "Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.\n",
      "Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!\n",
      "Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices.\n",
      "Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children's\n",
      "Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday\n",
      "Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice\n",
      "I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.\n",
      "Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps.\n",
      "Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!\n",
      "This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.\n",
      "My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.\n",
      "Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.\n",
      "I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great\n",

      "Nice reader. Light weight. Clear display! Portable\n",
      "Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children's\n",
      "This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.\n",
      "I got this because it is almost impossible to break\n",
      "The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.\n",
      "i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe\n",
      "My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to\n",
      "Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!\n",
      "I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon.

I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.\n",
      "Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc.\n",
      "I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also.\n",
      "I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.\n",
      "This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it.\n",
      "This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device\n",
      "It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store.\n",
      "Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like.\n",
      "This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.\n",
      "My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well\n",
      "Great..I love it..Glad I got it..My nephew loves it.\n",
      "This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.\n",
      "Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight\n",
      "Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK\n",
      "Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive\n",
      "great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all.\n",
      "I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden\n",

      "It ended up being the most popular gift that she got it does a wonderful job for children\n",
      "My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.\n",
      "These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.\n",
      "Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.\n",
      "It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device\n",
      "I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It's the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\n",
      "Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each\n",
      "I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.\n",
      "My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .\n",
      "I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile.\n",
      "If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.\n",
      "We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.\n",
      "I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.\n",
      "Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.\n",
      "The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids.\n",
      "The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.\n",
      "Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.\n",
      "Love that I could get it in a color! And it's just the right size for little hands.\n",
      "Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.\n",
      "great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen\n",
      "I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5.\n",
      "I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money\n",
      "Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning\n",
      "My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a \"kid proof\" case.\n",
      "OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!\n",
      "It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!\n",
      "I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.\n",
      "It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.\n",
      "I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.\n",
      "Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with.\n",
      "My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank.\n",
      "Son loves it........................................\n",
      "Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,\n",
      "Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.\n",
      "The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.\n",
      "Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids\n",
      "This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle.\n",
      "I purchased this tablet for my 10 year old son and he loves it. Great for movies, games and reading books online. Definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children. The hard protective cover is a plus.\n",
      "Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped.\n",
      "After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg\n",
      "This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.\n",
      "Such a great product. I like that it is very small and fit in my purse. I like that the battery last for a very long time.\n",
      "Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!\n",
      "I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.\n",
      "This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.\n",
      "Great product and great service from bestbuy online\n",
      "Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games.\n",
      "Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games.\n",

      "This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.\n",
      "These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.\n",
      "The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.\n",
      "i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.\n",
      "My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.\n",
      "Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.\n",
      "Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .\n",

      "Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.\n",
      "Plan to buy a second a second Amazon Kindle for a hi e year old.\n",
      "My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter\n",
      "works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem\n",
      "Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it.\n",
      "Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great.\n",
      "Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.\n",

      "Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it\n",
      "I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.\n",
      "Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.\n",
      "Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.\n",
      "It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..\n",

      "My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.\n",
      "My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch\n",
      "The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.\n",
      "My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.\n",
      "My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!\n",
      "I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!\n",
      "I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.\n",
      "It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.\n",
      "My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones\n",
      "So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!\n",
      "Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.\n",
      "Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the \"FIRE\"\n",
      "I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.\n",
      "Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.\n",
      "Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.\n",
      "There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.\n",

      "We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it.\n",
      "Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.\n",
      "We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry.\n",

      "My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it.\n",
      "The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.\n",
      "This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.\n",
      "I will recommend for other parents to buy this product\n",
      "It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.\n",

      "Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.\n",
      "Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.\n",
      "My child loves playing with the Kindle fire. It is entertaining and educational.\n",
      "Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.\n",
      "I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.\n",
      "Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too\n",
      "purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it.\n",

      "Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it.\n",
      "I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that.\n",

      "My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it\n",

Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.\n",
      "I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.\n",

      "Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect.\n",
      "It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.\n",
      "This tablet is great for trips. Just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have Internet. The case is great for kids who are rough with technology, it really takes a beating.\n",

      "This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps.\n",
      "I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the \"safe zone\". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program\n",

      "My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.\n",

      "I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!\n",
      "When used with AMAZON Prime and the \"FreeTime\" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson.\n",
      "Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.\n",
      "I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome\n",
      "I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups\n",
      "This is an awesome product.I also own a paperwhite, if you always read in good lighting I would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite.\n",
      "Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.\n",

      "Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.\n",
      "Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.\n",
      "Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where\n",
      "This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n",
      "It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use\n",
      "Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.\n",
      "I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.\n",
      "I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.\n",
      "Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G\n",
      "This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.\n",
      "It's a good device for children because they don't know any better\n",
      "Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.\n",
      "Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.\n",
      "Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also\n",
      "Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use\n",
      "I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!\n",

      "Awseome tablet for kids. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.\n",
      "My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!\n",
      "She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school\n",
      "My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!\n",
      "This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!\n",
      "We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much.\n",
      "Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I was unable to find a new Kindle in-store and was excited to find Best Buy had them online and I could purchase it and have it delivered simply and easily.\n",
      "There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.\n",
      "I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift.\n",
      "Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!\n",

      "My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty.\n",
      "I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it.\n",
      "The Amazon Kindle is a series of e-readers designed and marketed by Amazon. Amazon Kindle devices enable users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the Kindle Store.\n",
      "My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.\n",
      "Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.\n",
      "Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.\n",

      "My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.\n",
      "I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.\n",
      "My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE\n",

      "Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it\n",
      "My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...\n",
      "Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot.\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.\n",
      "This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety.\n",
      "Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games\n",
      "We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad\n",
      "I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.\n",
      "Took some time to get use to the Kindle Reader (use to the IPad), but I like that I can read without distractions.\n",
      "This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.\n",
      "This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!\n",
      "I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it.\n",
      "Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.\n",
      "This is the best purchase I've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it\n",
      "I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.\n",
      "My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints.\n",
      "Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet\n",
      "this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.\n",
      "Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.\n",
      "It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.\n",
      "purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software\n",
      "It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android\n",
      "It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.\n",
      "My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books.\n",
      "Item work well and was easy to read from in day light\n",
      "Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it\n",
      "So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.\n",
      "Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue.\n",
      "No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.\n",
      "I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!\n",
      "Good product for a young child to play with without breaking\n",
      "I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.\n",
      "Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi\n",
      "I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor\n",
      "The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.\n",
      "So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !\n",
      "Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it\n",
      "grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use\n",
      "Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case\n",
      "I like this ereader. It is a little small, but you can increase the font.\n",
      "I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.\n",
      "We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!\n",
      "This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.\n",
      "My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.\n",
      "I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...\n",
      "Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet\n",
      "I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.\n",
      "This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!\n",
      "While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far.\n",
      "bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids\n",
      "Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.\n",
      "great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options\n",
      "Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.\n",
      "I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.\n",
      "It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!\n",
      "I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.\n",
      "I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets.\n",
      "It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...\n",
      "I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a \"kiddie\" tablet, as she calls them.\n",
      "We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.\n",
      "It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!\n",
      "I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work.\n",
      "Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.\n",
      "This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker.\n",
      "My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight\n",
      "Great product. Highly recommended. Great value and great price\n",
      "Good product with very nice price. Love it! Will return again.\n",
      "i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.\n",
      "Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around\n",
      "Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.\n",
      "Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.\n",
      "purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!\n",
      "I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.\n",
      "Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance.\n",
      "Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.\n",
      "Great price great product would recommend this gift\n",
      "Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.\n",
      "Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not \"kid friendly\" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!\n",
      "Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage.\n",
      "Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks.\n",
      "got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.\n",
      "We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.\n",
      "Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.\n",
      "This has been awesome. For my. 5 year old nephew. Keeps him entertained and it works great.\n",
      "I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded\n",
      "I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!\n",
      "This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!\n",
      "Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient\n",
      "I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me\n",
      "Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price\n",
      "I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks\n",
      "I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it\n",
      "Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!\n",
      "The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that\n",
      "Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.\n",
      "This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.\n",
      "I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.\n",
      "Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.\n",
      "Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can't put it down.\n",
      "My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help\n",
      "This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8\" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate.\n",
      "My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents\n",
      "This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.\n",
      "I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!\n",
      "So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!\n",
      "I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.\n",
      "It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.\n",
      "Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot.\n",
      "Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.\n",
      "Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.\n",
      "Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!\n",
      "Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.\n",
      "Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.\n",
      "The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.\n",
      "Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices.\n",
      "my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.\n",
      "Just what she needed to keep her interested in short games & letters\n",
      "The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls\n",
      "This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.\n",
      "This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.\n",
      "Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use\n",
      "Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up\n",
      "Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it\n",
      "Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.\n",
      "Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.\n",
      "I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.\n",
      "This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.\n",
      "Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.\n",
      "I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked.\n",
      "My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.\n",
      "It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet\n",
      "It is so easy to use it is super light, and makes a book to read with no effort at all!\n",
      "Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff.\n",
      "I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps\n",
      "I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups\n",
      "Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up\n",
      "My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink.\n",
      "This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen\n",
      "This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading\n",
      "Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere.\n",
      "I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes.\n",
      "Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.\n",

      "I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.\n",
      "I'm enjoying the ease of having several reading options without the bulk.\n",
      "Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.\n",
      "I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.\n",
      "(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one.\n",
      "It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...\n",
      "Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it\n",
      "Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.\n",

      "My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money\n",
      "Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark\n",
      "This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.\n",
      "I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.\n",
      "Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet.\n",
      "They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings\n",
      "This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!\n",
      "Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!\n",
      "I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.\n",
      "I bought this for reading/listening books. Love the availability to expand the memory. Now I can load movies and tons of books! :-)\n",
      "The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.\n",
      "these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper.\n",
      "Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.\n",
      "I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself.\n",
      "I have not stopped reading on this amazon fire. Love it!!\n",
      "We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.\n",
      "Great tablet for kids to learn puzzles and letters. Has tons of activities for children and a full tablet for adults perfect if you have pime!\n",
      "I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.\n",
      "My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe\n",
      "I loooooove this tablet as well as my 3 year old with all the kids apps make it way more fun and safe for kids to enjoy\n",

      "can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup.\n",
      "I bought my Kindle because I heard it was good for reading in direct sunlight. I‚Äôve got a bay window I like to read at and other tablets I‚Äôve read on produce a lot of glare. This has zero glare and I can‚Äôt wait to take it camping this Spring/Summer/Fall. A side note, this is way lighter than any book (as you may have guessed). I like to read on my back and having this has drastically increased the amount of time I can read for.\n",
      "I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!\n",
      "I purchased the kindle light because I love to read and needed something that would not die quickly. I also needed something smaller and lighter that could go anywhere with me. I love my purchase and a must have for all book worms.\n",

      "You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.\n",
      "I purchase 2 on Super Bowl Sunday for my 5 & 7 year old birthday. It was the perfect gift, because the 2 love their gift. The tablets was for a girl and a boy, so I purchase a pink & a blue. The tablet is very child proof.\n",

      "I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.\n",
      "Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants.\n",
      "I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands.\n",
      "Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.\n",

      "We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it.\n",
      "I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.\n",
      "My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!\n",
      "BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT\n",
      "I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).\n",
      "These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.\n",
      "I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money.\n",
      "Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone\n",
      "So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all\n",
      "Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks\n",
      "Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of.\n",
      "Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.\n",
      "My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy.\n",
      "Small & without audio but easy to use. Able to connect to Amazon account & Goodreads account easily. The only thing I hate is that I have to keep restarting it if I want to get out of a ebook that I‚Äôm currently reading\n",
      "Replaced a kindle 6 that crashed so fare everything is great. Larger screen fast response,more storage. Don't have to charge as often. Well pleased.\n",

      "Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!\n",
      "Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.\n",
      "Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.\n",
      "Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend\n",
      "Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM\n",
      "Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.\n",
      "he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great\n",

      "It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it.\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.\n",
      "MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN\n",
      "This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory\n",

      "I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!\n",
      "My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble.\n",
      "I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.\n",

      "Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power.

As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly.\n",

      "Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.\n",
      "I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.\n",
      "This is just what we needed for a you k8d ..the apps are great\n",
      "easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty\n",
      "4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.\n",
      "Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the \"best \"gift.\n",
      "Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you\n",
      "I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers.\n",
      "This is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free. It keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning.\n",
      "Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet\n",
      "This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read.\n",
      "We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.\n",
      "This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It's definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that!\n",
      "Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children\n",
      "This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!\n",
      "This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark\n",
      "Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good.\n",
      "Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well\n",
      "My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!\n",
      "works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet\n",
      "WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items.\n",
      "Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc.\n",
      "My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.\n",
      "Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.\n",
      "Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).\n",
      "Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound\n",
      "I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is\n",
      "I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few \"I didn't understand that\" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.\n",
      "Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.\n",
      "I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.\n",
      "I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.\n",
      "Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.\n",
      "Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!\n",
      "I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!\n",
      "These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!\n",
      "Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books\n",
      "good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.\n",
      "If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.\n",
      "I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I \"needed\" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.\n",
      "Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.\n",
      "Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him\n",
      "great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.\n",
      "I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!\n",
      "Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!\n",
      "I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.\n",
      "Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up\n",
      "Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.\n",
      "We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.\n",
      "I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.\n",
      "Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.\n",
      "Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.\n",
      "Great product for when you are on the go.great sound\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!\n",
      "the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79\n",
      "This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.\n",
      "I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though\n",
      "It's a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical.\n",
      "This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.\n",
      "When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same \"alexa\" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.\n",
      "I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.\n",
      "This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.\n",
      "Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-\n",
      "The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?\n",
      "Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.\n",
      "just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.\n",
      "purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.\n",
      "Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.\n",
      "Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.\n",
      "would get another, works great, having fun with all the options\n",
      "Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.\n",
      "This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.\n",
      "It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.\n",
      "The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it\n",
      "The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.\n",
      "Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.\n",
      "It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.\n",
      "This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!\n",
      "I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.\n",
      "I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.\n",
      "Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!\n",
      "The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT\"S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!\n",
      "Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun\n",
      "Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions\n",
      "This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.\n",
      "This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically \"tap\" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.\n",
      "This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it\n",
      "bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!\n",
      "I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day.\n",
      "Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.\n",
      "Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.\n",
      "I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate\n",
      "Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable.\n",
      "This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button\n",
      "I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase.\n",
      "I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!\n",
      "This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.\n",
      "The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.\n",
      "hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear\n",
      "Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use.\n",
      "So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all\n",
      "With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.\n",
      "I added to a \"dot\" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!\n",
      "Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can.\n",
      "This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.\n",
      "This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it\n",
      "Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.\n",
      "I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.\n",
      "This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.\n",
      "It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends\n",
      "I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.\n",
      "Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses\n",
      "I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.\n",
      "I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.\n",
      "I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.\n",
      "I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack\n",
      "Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to \"tap\" the speaker to get it to listen.\n",
      "The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.\n",
      "We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!\n",
      "This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say \"I do not understand your question. \"\n",
      "Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.\n",
      "I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say \"Alexa.\" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.\n",
      "I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing\n",
      "I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one.\n",
      "The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.\n",
      "I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!\n",
      "I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.\n",
      "I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!\n",
      "I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.\n",
      "excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again\n",
      "Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price\n",
      "When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't\n",
      "We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.\n",
      "This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality\n",
      "Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.\n",
      "I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Good price works great would buy again good value for the price\n",
      "Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it.\n",
      "Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.\n",
      "Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.\n",
      "I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do\n",
      "Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody\n",
      "We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.\n",
      "Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say \"Alexa\" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!\n",
      "The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.\n",
      "Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.\n",
      "Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.\n",
      "Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!\n",
      "Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.\n",
      "I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.\n",
      "Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.\n",
      "Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality\n",
      "I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap\n",
      "Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the \"home\" button to use Alexa\n",
      "I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.\n",
      "Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal\n",
      "You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.\n",
      "The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to \"tap\" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.\n",
      "This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!\n",
      "Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.\n",
      "Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.\n",
      "I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.\n",
      "From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!\n",
      "This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.\n",
      "I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR\n",
      "I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!\n",
      "I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget.\n",
      "Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!\n",
      "Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.\n",
      "What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office.\n",
      "Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.\n",
      "I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where\n",
      "I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!\n",
      "I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.\n",
      "I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.\n",
      "Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming\n",
      "I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.\n",
      "Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.\n",
      "For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.\n",
      "The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.\n",
      "It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.\n",
      "I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo\n",
      "Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment\n",
      "It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.\n",
      "Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.\n",
      "I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.\n",
      "If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the \"button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.\n",
      "Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.\n",
      "I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund\n",
      "I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.\n",
      "I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.\n",
      "Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.\n",
      "I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy\n",
      "Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.\n",
      "I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the \"tap\" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...\n",
      "This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.\n",
      "Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.\n",
      "Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!\n",
      "Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions\n",
      "I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.\n",
      "We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.\n",
      "I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.\n",
      "Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked\n",
      "Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.\n",
      "Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.\n",
      "It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!\n",
      "I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.\n",
      "I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.\n",
      "Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.\n",
      "The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.\n",
      "this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats\n",
      "It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station\n",
      "This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.\n",
      "The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music\n",
      "Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....\n",
      "I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.\n",
      "Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.\n",
      "Thoughts of being able to have the Echo \"grow\" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.\n",
      "Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price\n",
      "I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!\n",
      "Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....\n",
      "I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.\n",
      "The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.\n",
      "Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.\n",
      "Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!\n",
      "Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.\n",
      "I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.\n",
      "We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.\n",
      "Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.\n",
      "Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.\n",
      "This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.\n",
      "Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!\n",
      "i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.\n",
      "Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.\n",
      "I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.\n",
      "Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa\n",
      "My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.\n",
      "Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.\n",
      "Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift\n",
      "This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.\n",
      "Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must \"Tap\" the button before speaking.\n",
      "Great tech works well highly recommended no issues\n",
      "Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.\n",
      "Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.\n",
      "I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.\n",
      "This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .\n",
      "Bought an IPad and didn't like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve.\n",
      "Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow.\n",
      "I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus\n",
      "Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.\n",
      "Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites\n",
      "Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.\n",
      "Got this laptop for an in-bound college student. Best option that I found.\n",
      "Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need.\n",

      "The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)\n",

      "I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an \"auto brightness\" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.\n",

      "Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use\n",
      "My first tablet. OUTSTANDING for NETFLIX, email, etc.\n",
      "The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better\n",
      "This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .\n",
      "I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.\n",
      "An amazing electronic tool, so portable, great storage, books, great convenience.\n",
      "I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.\n",
      "I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.\n",
      "Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age..\n",
      "This Kindle is alot larger and better for viewing.\n",
      "I find the picture quality amazing, the size over earlier model is welcome. Also, battery lasts many hours. For the price, it is a real bargain.\n",
      "Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.\n",
      "My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy.\n",
      "Sales guy didn't have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn't very helpful in getting me started.\n",
      "Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though\n",
      "Want a port for addition memory this model had it!\n",
      "This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability\n",
      "For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak\n",
      "I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book\n",
      "Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.\n",
      "This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.\n",
      "Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase\n",
      "I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.\n",
      "I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars\n",
      "very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price\n",
      "Nice tablet and very fast/capable. The storage options are way better than the previous models. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone in the market for one.\n",
      "Easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price\n",
      "I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! You can't beat it for the price!\n",
      "Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.\n",
      "I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.\n",
      "Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.\n",
      "Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers\n",
      "I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.\n",
      "Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.\n",
      "I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.\n",
      "This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.\n",
      "I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.\n",
      "We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.\n",
      "When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.\n",
      "Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.\n",
      "Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping\n",
      "Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now.\n",
      "My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone.\n",
      "This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.\n",
      "I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)\n",
      "The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.\n",
      "I got this for my mom to use as her \"computer\" and I am so happy with it. It's ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!!\n",
      "Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age..\n",
      "My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!\n",
      "makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.\n",
      "I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!\n",
      "The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet.\n",
      "Love my new kindle, thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few days, all is good. Very thin , got a case for it, I now feel at home with it. Do not like the \"new\" lock screen lock to open the tablet at all, its tiny and hard to \"unlock\" most always taking several times to swipe it just right.\n",
      "Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it.\n",
      "Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.\n",
      "This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.\n",
      "Employees were very helpful. I always enjoy shopping at Best Buy.\n",
      "Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.\n",
      "Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.\n",
      "I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It's almost as good as I IPad.\n",
      "Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive.\n",
      "The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!\n",
      "Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.\n",
      "Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.\n",
      "Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa\n",
      "I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.\n",
      "so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one....\n",
      "Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.\n",
      "I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the \"page turn\" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.\n",
      "this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...\n",
      "I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version\n",
      "Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.\n",
      "Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.\n",
      "I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.\n",
      "The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.\n",
      "Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.\n",
      "The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.\n",
      "This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.\n",
      "This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.\n",
      "Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!\n",
      "Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.\n",
      "Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!\n",
      "Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space\n",
      "The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading\n",
      "I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.\n",
      "This is my third Kindle and the best one yet. Love the new controls, the backlit page, the compact size and the ease of use. I would recommend the Kindle Voyage to all readers!\n",
      "The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.\n",
      "I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.\n",
      "Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.\n",
      "It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level.\n",
      "I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.\n",
      "bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it\n",
      "Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience.\n",
      "I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.\n",
      "So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.\n",
      "I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining.\n",
      "Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun...\n",
      "Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.\n",
      "Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!.\n",
      "Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.\n",
      "One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)\n",
      "What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.\n",
      "excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost\n",
      "Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.\n",
      "This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.\n",
      "Love this kindle - the press side page turner is great.\n",
      "Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly\n",
      "The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!\n",
      "This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks.\n",
      "I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly.\n",
      "The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.\n",
      "Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.\n",
      "I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.\n",
      "We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.\n",
      "I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.\n",
      "I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.\n",
      "Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.\n",
      "Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.\n",
      "I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's \"behind the counter\". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie.\n",
      "Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!\n",
      "New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.\n",
      "why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!\n",
      "I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.\n",
      "I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.\n",
      "Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.\n",
      "Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.\n",
      "I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own.\n",
      "Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.\n",
      "Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model.\n",
      "This is my third one of these and this is the best one by far.\n",
      "This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.\n",
      "This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it.\n",
      "I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.\n",
      "My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes.\n",
      "We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.\n",
      "Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small\n",
      "the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.\n",
      "Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.\n",
      "Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.\n",
      "Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.\n",
      "It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks.\n",
      "My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.\n",
      "I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It's exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It's a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag.\n",
      "This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.\n",
      "I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.\n",
      "This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.\n",
      "outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2\n",
      "This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.\n",
      "She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.\n",
      "I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!\n",
      "this item work just as I expected it to, great product!\n",
      "This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.\n",
      "I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well\n",
      "I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads.\n",
      "I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.\n",
      "This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version.\n",
      "purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g\n",
      "This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel\n",
      "Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money.\n",
      "Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.\n",
      "Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.\n",
      "Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable\n",
      "Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for!\n",
      "Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet.\n",
      "Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend\n",
      "Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder\n",
      "I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .\n",
      "I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.\n",
      "I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely.\n",
      "As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.\n",
      "Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.\n",
      "Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.\n",
      "This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping!\n",

      "Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!\n",
      "horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties\n",
      "Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far\n",
      "my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!\n",
      "I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.\n",
      "Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!\n",
      "The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books.\n",
      "Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure\n",
      "Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts.\n",
      "We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.\n",
      "Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.\n",
      "Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.\n",
      "Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!\n",
      "This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture.\n",
      "Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading\n",
      "Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.\n",
      "Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.\n",
      "my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !\n",
      "Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!\n",
      "I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\".\n",
      "I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad.\n",
      "The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet\n",
      "I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon!\n",
      "Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.\n",
      "Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money\n",
      "I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration.\n",
      "This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.\n",
      "I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.\n",
      "Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading\n",
      "My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!\n",
      "Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view\n",
      "I love to read! Books,books, books and more books.\n",
      "My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!\n",
      "So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.\n",
      "I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code \"shimmering\" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.\n",
      "We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value.\n",
      "I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price.\n",
      "This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase\n",
      "Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.\n",

      "This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you.\n",
      "A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don't use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions.\n",

      "It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.\n",
      "I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!\n",
      "We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work.\n",
      "Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot.\n",
      "Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.\n",
      "I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.\n",

      "Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...\n",

      "Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.\n",
      "This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.\n",
      "My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.\n",
      "I bought four of these for my kids and they love them\n",
      "Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.\n",
      "Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.\n",
      "I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.\n",
      "The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.\n",
      "Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.\n",
      "This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.\n",
      "It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person.\n",
      "I love this tablet! It's the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable!\n",
      "It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want.\n",

      "I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.\n",
      "The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.\n",
      "This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one\n",
      "I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.\n",
      "My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch.\n",
      "Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.\n",

      "Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!\n",
      "The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,\n",
      "My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price.\n",
      "Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.\n",
      "I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK.\n",
      "Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies\n",
      "Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.\n",
      "Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price.\n",
      "Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games\n",
      "Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend.\n",
      "Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use.\n",
      "My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.\n",
      "Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price\n",
      "good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.\n",
      "Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display\n",
      "This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!\n",
      "This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read..\n",
      "The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.\n",
      "This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.\n",
      "The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8\" vs. 7\") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors.\n",
      "It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS.\n",
      "My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc.\n",
      "This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down.\n",

      "Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.\n",
      "I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one.\n",
      "The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.\n",
      "I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.\n",
      "Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!\n",
      "My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.\n",
      "It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook\n",
      "I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage\n",
      "I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance.\n",
      "The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad\n",
      "I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.\n",

      "i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.\n",
      "My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect.\n",
      "I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.\n",
      "Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.\n",
      "This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.\n",
      "My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present\n",

      "Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!\n",
      "I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!\n",
      "I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it.\n",
      "Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ).\n",
      "Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.\n",

      "Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday\n",
      "I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages.\n",
      "My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them.\n",
      "Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child\n",
      "Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.\n",
      "Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games.\n",
      "We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.\n",
      "Works great for everything we want our daughter to do\n",
      "I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars\n",

      "Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!\n",
      "If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.\n",
      "seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1\n",
      "Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets\n",
      "I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money\n",

      "We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals\n",
      "I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.\n",

      "Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures.\n",
      "Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature.\n",
      "Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.\n",
      "Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use.\n",
      "This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.\n",
      "I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it.\n",
      "fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!\n",
      "We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!\n",
      "I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc.\n",
      "This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc.\n",
      "Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!\n",
      "Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend\n",
      "was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.\n",
      "Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.\n",
      "I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!\n",
      "Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet.\n",
      "Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.\n",
      "Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for.\n",
      "These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well.\n",

      "Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you\n",
      "I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.\n",
      "I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.\n",
      "This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back.\n",
      "This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price.\n",
      "Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.\n",
      "I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!\n",
      "love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.\n",
      "Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price.\n",
      "Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment.\n",
      "I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.\n",
      "bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for\n",
      "The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!\n",
      "Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs\n",
      "I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.\n",
      "Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.\n",
      "I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.\n",
      "the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled.\n",
      "A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing.\n",
      "Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.\n",
      "Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.\n",
      "Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.\n",
      "i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime\n",
      "Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.\n",
      "Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.\n",
      "This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.\n",
      "Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.\n",
      "This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.\n",
      "Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.\n",
      "I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.\n",
      "I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile\n",
      "We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better.\n",
      "We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group.\n",
      "Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price\n",
      "I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.\n",
      "So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.\n",
      "We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version.\n",
      "It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present\n",
      "Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.\n",
      "Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.\n",
      "Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.\n",
      "Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.\n",
      "Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.\n",
      "very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months\n",
      "A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while.\n",
      "Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good\n",
      "Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.\n",
      "For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!\n",
      "Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.\n",
      "We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.\n",
      "It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps\n",
      "Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire\n",
      "Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....\n",
      "This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with\n",
      "Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money.\n",
      "So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !\n",
      "Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.\n",
      "Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!\n",
      "This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality\n",
      "very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient\n",
      "The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.\n",
      "My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.\n",
      "I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase.\n",
      "We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!\n",
      "I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc√©.\n",
      "I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.\n",
      "great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday\n",
      "Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases\n",
      "I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics.\n",
      "does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.\n",
      "Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive\n",
      "The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable.\n",
      "Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere\n",
      "Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great!\n",
      "I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.\n",
      "I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!\n",
      "I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.\n",
      "I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one.\n",
      "I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names.\n",

      "I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.\n",

The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.\n",
      "I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product.\n",

      "I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!\n",
      "This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)\n",
      "Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.\n",

      "Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!\n",
      "This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.\n",
      "my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger\n",
      "I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.\n",

      "Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features.\n",
      "I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon.\n",
      "Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.\n",
      "Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.\n",
      "Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games.\n",
      "At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.\n",
      "The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.\n",
      "bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features...\n",

      "I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!\n",
      "I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.\n",
      "I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.\n",
      "Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.\n",
      "I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right\n",
      "The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.\n",
      "I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.\n",
      "I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it\n",
      "whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift.\n",
      "Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.\n",
      "bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!\n",
      "works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos\n",

      "Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.\n",
      "I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.\n",
      "Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.\n",
      "I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.\n",
      "My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.\n",
      "Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8\" and I would like to try a 7\" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones.\n",
      "Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages\n",
      "Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage\n",
      "For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet\n",
      "I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.\n",
      "Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.\n",
      "Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.\n",
      "Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.\n",
      "Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.\n",
      "For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books\n",
      "I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version.\n",
      "It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.\n",
      "Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it.\n",
      "this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.\n",
      "I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations\n",
      "I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.\n",
      "Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.\n",
      "Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now.\n",
      "I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.\n",
      "For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.\n",
      "Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.\n",
      "My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!\n",
      "This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet.\n",
      "Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. .\n",
      "Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture\n",
      "The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.\n",
      "Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?\n",
      "Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use\n",
      "I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend\n",
      "I've had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick.\n",
      "Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.\n",
      "This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.\n",
      "Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.\n",
      "I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device.\n",
      "Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs\n",
      "Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get.\n",
      "This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!.\n",
      "Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long.\n",
      "I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation.\n",
      "It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value.\n",
      "I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.\n",
      "Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).\n",
      "I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.\n",
      "Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits.\n",
      "One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.\n",
      "A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.\n",
      "This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value.\n",
      "I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast.\n",
      "I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.\n",
      "It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.\n",
      "Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.\n",

      "Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games\n",

      "Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case\n",
      "Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.\n",
      "The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.\n",
      "I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.\n",
      "Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.\n",

      "Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!\n",

      "Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.\n",
      "I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!\n",
      "This product is easy to use and take along with you\n",

      "Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement.\n",
      "I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions.\n",

      "This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast\n",
      "I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me.\n",
      "The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.\n",
      "Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.\n",
      "Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop.\n",
      "Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.\n",
      "I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them.\n",
      "Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults.\n",
      "Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack\n",
      "Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend.\n",
      "Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer\n",
      "Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it.\n",
      "I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .\n",
      "Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.\n",
      "Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)\n",
      "Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one.\n",
      "This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!\n",
      "I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it\n",
      "This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!\n",
      "This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!\n",
      "This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.\n",
      "Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.\n",
      "the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.\n",
      "A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled.\n",
      "Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!\n",
      "Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.\n",
      "Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!\n",
      "Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle.\n",
      "This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.\n",
      "My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.\n",
      "The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc...\n",
      "Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!\n",
      "I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails.\n",
      "Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....\n",
      "Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.\n",
      "Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities\n",
      "Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.\n",
      "Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for.\n",
      "I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this\n",
      "This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you.\n",
      "We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.\n",
      "Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price\n",
      "I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.\n",
      "Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift\n",
      "This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook\n",
      "I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.\n",
      "Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.\n",
      "I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though.\n",
      "Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.\n",
      "It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks\n",
      "Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire\n",
      "I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.\n",
      "I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.\n",
      "Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone.\n",
      "Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.\n",
      "Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.\n",
      "The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!\n",
      "Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.\n",
      "Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift\n",
      "Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product\n",
      "Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7\"). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better.\n",
      "It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.\n",
      "Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.\n",
      "I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase.\n",
      "The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old\n",
      "Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far.\n",
      "Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes\n",
      "nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain\n",
      "Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips\n",
      "WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE!\n",
      "I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.\n",
      "I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music.\n",
      "I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!\n",
      "Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.\n",
      "This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.\n",
      "Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.\n",
      "The 8\" version is much better than the older 7\" version. Better graphics and faster processor\n",
      "My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.\n",
      "Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price!\n",
      "We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!\n",
      "For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon.\n",
      "A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.\n",
      "I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.\n",
      "I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use\n",
      "I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.\n",
      "It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it\n",
      "Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!\n",
      "Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good!\n",
      "It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.\n",
      "Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price\n",
      "needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us\n",
      "This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.\n",
      "Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.\n",
      "I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.\n",
      "I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.\n",
      "This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen.\n",
      "There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well.\n",
      "Great device very functional love it will recommend\n",
      "I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.\n",
      "This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.\n",
      "I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!\n",
      "First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus.\n",
      "Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate.\n",
      "I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.\n",
      "I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read.\n",
      "This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer.\n",
      "Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!\n",
      "Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!\n",
      "it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need\n",
      "The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great.\n",
      "I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money\n",
      "Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung\n",
      "This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.\n",
      "This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand.\n",
      "Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size\n",
      "I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!\n",
      "This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed.\n",
      "I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.\n",
      "Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.\n",
      "This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.\n",
      "This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.\n",
      "Always a good price and good for what it's meant for.\n",
      "Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list\n",
      "very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.\n",
      "Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read\n",
      "Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children\n",
      "its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader.\n",
      "On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!\n",
      "This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.\n",
      "Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders\n",
      "It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.\n",
      "Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome.\n",
      "Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price\n",
      "Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.\n",
      "Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!\n",
      "make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.\n",
      "My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.\n",
      "Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.\n",
      "This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.\n",
      "I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!\n",
      "I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids.\n",
      "Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!\n",
      "One of the best tablets on the market for its value\n",
      "I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.\n",
      "My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.\n",
      "This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.\n",
      "Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far.\n",
      "Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks\n",
      "I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.\n",
      "Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7\". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast.\n",
      "Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse\n",
      "I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.\n",
      "Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!\n",
      "Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet.\n",
      "I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.\n",
      "Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!\n",
      "Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well\n",
      "Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon\n",
      "It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs.\n",
      "Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.\n",
      "I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!\n",
      "I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet\n",
      "I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use.\n",
      "I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.\n",
      "The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone\n",
      "I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books....\n",
      "Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane\n",
      "I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money.\n",
      "I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned.\n",
      "Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price.\n",
      "It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy\n",
      "Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.\n",
      "This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.\n",
      "This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.\n",
      "Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books.\n",
      "Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.\n",
      "Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.\n",
      "Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!\n",
      "My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money.\n",
      "I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great.\n",
      "This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.\n",
      "I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.\n",
      "I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.\n",
      "I would buy another one for the priceGood product\n",

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.\n",

      "The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.\n",
      "Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.\n",
      "Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!\n",
      "It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her.\n",
      "nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity\n",
      "I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.\n",
      "Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen\n",
      "The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.\n",
      "This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don't do a lot on a tablet, it's a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now.\n",
      "The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!\n",
      "I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.\n",
      "It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps\n",
      "I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod\n",

I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.\n",

But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted.

I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.\n",

Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games.\n",

      "Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player.\n",

      "I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.\n",
      "Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.\n",

      "Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows.\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!\n",
      "I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.\n",
      "It is a great tablet believe it or not it is also great for kids use parental controls.\n",

      "My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day\n",

The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer.\n",
      "I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.\n",
      "I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools.\n",
      "This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!\n",
      "Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!\n",
      "With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD.\n",

      "If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!\n",
      "Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.\n",
      "We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.\n",
      "The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.\n",
      "No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9\n",

      "I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.\n",
      "I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime.\n",
      "I bought Geek Squad for 2 years. Well after 13 months my device became broken. So the warranty came in handy. Thank you knowing things happend in life.\n",
      "My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.\n",
      "This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.\n",
      "My 5 year old loves his tablet. It's perfect for him.\n",
      "This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.\n",
      "Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all\n",
      "I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.\n",

      "This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.\n",
      "My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed\n",
      "Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable\n",
      "Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it.\n",
      "Does everything I need and has a long battery life.\n",
      "i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd\n",
      "This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.\n",
      "the back light nad easier to read in all lightings\n",
      "Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands.\n",
      "Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train.\n",
      "This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.\n",
      "I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light\n",
      "The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.\n",
      "I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.\n",
      "I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it\n",
      "Very happy and satisfiedEasier to handle. Fast charging\n",
      "It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it\n",
      "The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!\n",
      "I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool\n",
      "Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it.\n",
      "As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.\n",
      "Easy to use, good battery life, great back lighting.\n",
      "I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.\n",
      "Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.\n",
      "No complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always\n",
      "Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good.\n",
      "I love this e-reader. My other reader was not backlit so needed something I could use in low light. This works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. The light is adjustable. Love downloading books from the library. It has a 3G connection which I have not used yet, so far used only in wi-fi areas.\n",
      "Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants.\n",
      "This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive.\n",
      "Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!\n",
      "Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it\n",

      "Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself.\n",
      "This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient.....\n",

      "I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.\n",
      "this is my second one and must have one of these at all times\n",
      "In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.\n",

      "I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as \"howto\" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those \"fixes\" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps.\n",
      "I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them.

He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own.

      "Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!\n",
      "This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.\n",
      "When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!\n",
      "Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!\n",
      "Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK\n",
      "This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.\n",
      "Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.\n",
      "Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.\n",
      "I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.\n",

      "The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!\n",
      "lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle\n",
      "BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.\n",
      "Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader.\n",
      "This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.\n",
      "I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.\n",
      "The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case\n",
      "Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking\n",
      "This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small.\n",
      "Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though\n",
      "I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)\n",
      "I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!\n",
      "Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.\n",
      "Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.\n",
      "Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.\n",
      "I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.\n",
      "Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!\n",
      "Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.\n",
      "I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.\n",
      "Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer.\n",
      "Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.\n",
      "With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).\n",
      "It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing.\n",
      "New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.\n",
      "I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.\n",

      "Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.\n",
      "This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.\n",

      "I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.\n",
      "'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.\n",

      "Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.\n",

      "Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK\n",
      "Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.\n",
      "Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!\n",
      "Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.\n",

      "Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants.\n",
      "I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough.\n",
      "Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music.\n",
      "Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.\n",
      "Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free\n",
      "I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.\n",
      "I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!\n",
      "My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!\n",
      "Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!\n",
      "Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.\n",
      "I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.\n",
      "I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.\n",
      "Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do.\n",
      "Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it\n",
      "Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.\n",
      "This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.\n",
      "Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.\n",
      "Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.\n",
      "this is my second one and must have one of these at all times\n",
      "Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.\n",
      "Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!\n",
      "Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.\n",
      "Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.\n",
      "Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.\n",
      "The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.\n",
      "I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!\n",
      "Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though\n",
      "Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.\n",
      "Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!\n",
      "i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read\n",
      "She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL\n",
      "It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle.\n",
      "Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading\n",
      "my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.\n",
      "My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!\n",
      "I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos\n",
      "The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!\n",
      "Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!\n",
      "This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.\n",
      "I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.\n",
      "I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.\n",
      "For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only \"bad\" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.\n",
      "I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It's the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\n",
      "This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.\n",

The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.\n"

      "polarity of I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last. is: 0.24049707602339182\n"
